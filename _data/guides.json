Therefore, they are not translated back and forth when the <code class=\"html\">Language</code> preference is changed.<br>\n<br>However, because they are present by default when a new business is created, their names are known in advance, and they are included in the translation table. So when they are first created, their names will be in the language set under <kbd>Preferences</kbd>. If you plan to operate a business in a certain language, set that as your preference before creating the business. The placeholder groups and accounts will be titled in your desired language.

For example, a bilingual Spanish/English company could rename the default <em>Donations</em> account to <em>Donaciones | Donations</em>. (Automatic and control accounts will be translated by the program.)</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Enter field content, especially in custom fields, in the language of its intended audience. For example, payment terms on sales invoices should be in the language of the customer (or multiple languages).</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Consider creating custom themes for different languages.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Remember that Manager has no live translation capability, but is restricted to what the translation teams have put into the translation table. Switch back and forth between <code class=\"html\">Language</code> preferences to fully understand the effect and make necessary adjustments. Explore all aspects of the program when doing this.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-default\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-info-circle\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Note</strong><br>\nThe translation process is a collaborative, community effort.

    "html": "<h1 class=\"display-4 mb-4\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem\">Backup, restore and transfer businesses</h1><p>Accounting data for businesses  in Manager can be backed up, restored, and transferred using a backup file. A <strong>backup</strong> for a business stores all information necessary to completely recreate its accounting records, including transactions, customer and supplier information, inventory status, reports, attachments, as well as custom themes and settings. Using backups, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Recover data after it is lost, as when a storage drive fails</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Recover data from an earlier time, for example, before someone began making entry errors</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Transfer data between computers</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Build redundant data caches</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Migrate data to different editions of the program (desktop, server, or cloud)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A backup includes data of only one business. If you have multiple accounting entities, each must be backed up separately. If desired, these backups can be to separate locations. And a single business can be backed up to multiple locations.</p>\n<h3>Making a backup</h3>\n<p>As long as new accounting data is being recorded, backups should be made frequently. A general guideline is to back up your data often enough that you would be willing <strong>and able</strong> to re-enter recent data to bring your records up to date. For high-volume businesses, that realistically means backing up at least daily. For lower-volume entities, weekly or monthly backups might suffice, as long as necessary records would be available if data loss occurs.</p>\n<p>Creating a backup file is very simple. Under the <kbd>Businesses</kbd> tab, click on the name of the business you are backing up. (This step is unnecessary if you are already within the business.)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/3X/7/c/7c0afc2ec48cb8c493b764efb48c983241fbe205.png\" alt=\"13%20AM%20copy\" width=\"517\" height=\"51\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\">  <strong><i class=\"fal fa-hand-point-right text-muted m-2\" style=\"font-size: 22px\"></i></strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/a/a9f94ac35e351e19e8748b8217a2ea4b3302fe95.png\" width=\"248\" height=\"106\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>Then click the <kbd>Backup</kbd> button at the top right of the Manager window.</p>\n<p>Depending on your operating system, the software will offer to save the backup file somewhere on your local drive. Generally, you should choose a different location (see below). In this example, the backup is for a business named Northwind Traders.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/f/f0517c4066ec1dfe330e0fd9b4c043484a12fe75.png\" width=\"442\" height=\"62\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>The backup file name will contain a date stamp to indicate when the backup was created. Once you make multiple backups, it will be easy to see when individual backup files were generated:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/6/6e2ce680d7444b0a74132b710f556d8461ef19cb.png\" width=\"210\" height=\"139\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>You should store backups separately from your computer. That way, if the computer fails, the backup will remain intact. Choose an appropriate backup medium and location, considering cost, convenience, and the value you place on your accounting data (including the effort required to recreate it). For protection from hazards or theft, the backup should aso be kept at a separate physical location. Some possibilities include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">USB flash drive</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">External drive</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Network-connected drive</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Writable CDs or DVDs</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Cloud storage service (<em>e.g.</em>, Dropbox, OneDrive, or iCloud)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Restoring from backup</h3>\n<p>Restore a business from backup under the <kbd>Businesses</kbd> tab by clicking <kbd>Add Business</kbd> and selecting <em>Import Business</em>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/3X/7/3/73307a12055ef2e33de550bca48ab3cf8828946e.png\" alt=\"13%20AM\" width=\"190\" height=\"162\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>The next screen may look slightly different, depending on your operating system.

    "html": "<h1 class=\"display-4 mb-4\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem\">Choose between accrual or cash basis accounting</h1><p>An important decision for any business is whether to adopt accrual or cash basis accounting. In very simple terms, <strong>accrual basis accounting</strong> records income when earned and expenses when incurred, whether or not accompanying receipts and payments happen at the same time. (More technically, expenses are recorded during the period when the income they are associated with is earned.) <strong>Cash basis accounting</strong> records income when money is received and expenses when money is paid out.</p>\n<p>Accrual basis accounting more completely reports both financial performance and position. It is generally preferred by accountants, because it shows when revenue has been earned and debts incurred, regardless of whether money has yet changed hands. It provides more and better financial information for managing the business. Cash basis accounting is usually employed only by very small, simple businesses, often those without inventory. It emphasizes the importance of cash in a company’s financial picture.</p>\n<p>The choice between these options may be influenced by local laws. Many businesses start on the cash basis. But frequently, as revenue increases beyond some threshold or inventory is added, authorities require a change to accrual basis accounting. Manager can handle the switch easily.</p>\n<h3>Choosing overall accounting basis</h3>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-default\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-info-circle\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Note</strong><br>\nAccounting method cannot be selected until after the first sales or purchase invoice has been created.</p>\n</div></div>\n<p>To change between accrual and cash basis accounting in Manager, click <kbd>Set Period</kbd> at the top of the <kbd>Summary</kbd> page:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/3/381625883c624ffd3da7e119284f0e037528d295.png\" width=\"175\" height=\"45\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>Select one of the two accounting methods in the dropdown box and click <kbd>Update</kbd>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/d/d72c6c24a4cd682ab888e0f52aa11d0e52a76bb4.png\" width=\"284\" height=\"379\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-default\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-info-circle\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Note</strong><br>\nBalances of many accounts may change or disappear from the <kbd>Summary</kbd> when cash basis accounting is selected because elements contributing to them have not been recognized through receipt or payment of funds.

Most steps were designed to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Zero out income and expense accounts before starting a new accounting period</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Identify and correct errors</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Limit accumulation and propagation of mistakes from one period to the next</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These practices developed over centuries, not only to support meaningful analysis, but also to combat unavoidable omissions, mental miscalculations, and oversights when entering and posting hundreds or thousands of transactions manually.</p>\n<p>Manager eliminates the need for most of these steps by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Performing all calculations electronically, eliminating arithmetic errors</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Basing automatic double entries on type of transaction and account selection by the user, reducing the need for manual journal entries with their requirement to deduce which accounts to debit and credit</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Furnishing real-time feedback when journal entries <em>are</em> made, reducing the possibility of unbalanced transactions</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Leaving incorrect, incomplete, or unbalanced transactions in <em><a href=\"/guides/7106\">Suspense</a></em> until fixed</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Carrying forward information from one period to the next in a perpetual database</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Setting displays and reports to cover defined time periods</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Closing the books</h3>\n<p>At the end of any accounting period, just a few tasks are normally required. For many businesses, these steps are only performed annually:</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Make necessary adjusting entries (when using accrual basis accounting) for prepaid expenses and income items.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Make desired distributions of earnings to capital or equity accounts using journal entries.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Pay out desired dividends or draws.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<a href=\"/guides/7468\">Create desired reports</a> for the accounting period. These might be limited to a Profit and Loss Statement and Balance Sheet. Of course, others can be added to suit needs of management, accountants, or tax authorities. Reports can be printed, stored electronically, or just saved in Manager.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Consider locking past transactions by <a href=\"/guides/5510\">setting the lock date</a> once end-of-period adjustments are complete. This prevents changes to transactions forming the basis for statutory reporting obligations and tax returns.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-default\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-info-circle\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Note</strong><br>\nFor many small businesses, especially sole traders/proprietors, none of these steps might be necessary.

    "html": "<h1 class=\"display-4 mb-4\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem\">Design a chart of accounts</h1><p>A <strong>chart of accounts</strong> is an organized list of all accounts in a business entity’s financial records. An account is where a financial transaction is classified, allocated, or posted. (These terms all mean the same thing.)</p>\n<p>Every account has a balance based on additions and subtractions made since it was opened (or during a specified period of time). So summaries or totals of balances of various types or groups of accounts are often included when displaying a chart of accounts. But strictly speaking, only the accounts themselves make up the chart of accounts.</p>\n<p>The chart of accounts will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Govern how every single transaction a business makes is recorded</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Determine what information management views to make important decisions</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Support government regulatory and tax filings</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Organize information for presentation to bankers, owners, creditors, and auditors</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So it should be thought out carefully. Once it has been developed, written descriptions of which types of transactions are posted to each account are convenient reminders and can be helpful during audits, when working with accountants, and for training new users or reminding established ones.</p>\n<p>Although the effort of building a good chart of accounts produces no direct revenue, it costs little or nothing, but will improve operations far into the future. A well-designed chart of accounts ultimately makes your business easier to manage and can save time and money. Understanding some basics will help you develop a good one.</p>\n<h3>Types of accounts</h3>\n<p>Accounts have been classified the same way by accountants and bookkeepers everywhere for over 500 years. (Nobody said accounting was exciting.) Classification depends on whether accounts depict your current financial position or determine your performance over a period of time. They are named for the two most important financial statements of any company: the balance sheet and the profit and loss (P &amp; L) statement, also called the income statement.</p>\n<p>Accounts depicting position are called balance sheet accounts, because they appear on the balance sheet. (See, this is easy!) They are also sometimes referred to as permanent or perpetual accounts, because they carry forward from one accounting period to another. When up to date, they define the state of a business at the current moment.</p>\n<p><strong>Balance sheet accounts</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><em>Asset</em></strong> accounts represent the value of what you own, including cash, inventory, fixed assets, and other things.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><em>Liability</em></strong> accounts represent what you owe to others outside the business, including loans, employee wages earned but not yet paid, and so forth.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><em>Equity</em></strong> accounts record how much money is invested in the business, including profits that have not been distributed. Equity can be thought of as the net worth of a business. (Net worth is different from value, which is what someone might pay to buy the business.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Accounts determining performance are called profit and loss  or income statement accounts, because they appear on reports of the same name. (You probably predicted that.) Balances for these accounts are calculated over a specified timeframe or accounting period, such as a month, quarter, or year.</p>\n<p><strong>Profit and loss accounts</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><em>Income</em></strong> (or revenue) accounts record amounts earned by the business</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><em>Expense</em></strong> accounts record amounts spent on business activities (not including any withdrawals, dividends, or distributions to owners or shareholders)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Businesses may subdivide their accounts into elaborate hierarchies. But all accounts are one of those five basic types. There are no exceptions. (That would be too exciting.)</p>\n<h3>Accounting equations</h3>\n<p>Accounting begins with the simple equation:</p>\n<p><em>Assets</em> – <em>Liabilities</em> = <em>Equity</em></p>\n<p>This is just an accountant’s way of saying the difference between what a business owns and what it owes is its net worth. (You already knew that, right? This is getting simpler.)</p>\n<p>To make things seem mysterious so they can keep their jobs, accountants like to scramble that equation a little by moving <em>Liabilities</em> to the right side of the equation (reversing the sign, of course):</p>\n<p><em>Assets</em> = <em>Liabilities</em> + <em>Equity</em></p>\n<p>This version of the equation says the sum of all asset account balances must equal the sum of all liability and equity account balances. Details of this balance constitute your financial position at any given time. A proper chart of accounts and good accounting procedures make sure the two sides of the accounting equation are always equal. That’s what shows on a balance sheet, nothing more, though specific accounts in each type and their arrangement may vary.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nRavi has a bank account balance of 10,000 to start his messenger service. That is an asset. But 8,000 of that amount was obtained as a loan, a liability. Ravi’s equity, or net worth, is 2,000. In fact, that is the amount he had saved and put into the business venture. His accounting equation is:<br>\n<br>10,000 (<em>Assets</em>) = 8,000 (<em>Liabilities</em>) + 2,000 (<em>Equity</em>)</p>\n</div></div>\n<p>But how can a business grow (or fail, for that matter)? This is where those profit and loss accounts fit into the picture. Revenue earned by a business adds to <em>Assets</em>, possibly by increasing a bank account. Or it might take the form of a receivable, that is, an amount earned and invoiced to a customer but for which money has not yet been received from the customer. A receivable is still an asset, because it has value to your business.</p>\n<p>In contrast, expenditures by the business effectively decrease assets, reducing that bank account or creating a payable, or amount owed to a supplier. The accounting equation can be extended:</p>\n<p><em>Assets</em> = <em>Liabilities</em> + <em>Equity</em> + <em>Income</em> – <em>Expenses</em></p>\n<p>Elements of this equation can be grouped without changing its meaning:</p>\n<p><em>Assets</em> = <em>Liabilities</em> + <em>Equity</em> + (<em>Income</em> – <em>Expenses</em>)</p>\n<p>The portion in parentheses is called net profit and is what shows on the profit and loss statement and defines your performance. So the extended equation combines position and performance into one calculation, merging status at a moment with changes not yet transferred into the permanent accounts.</p>\n<p>If you spend less than you make, you are profitable. Profits can increase your <em>Assets</em>. Or they can reduce your <em>Liabilities</em>. Either increases <em>Equity</em>. The creative aspect of business involves using <em>Assets</em>, <em>Liabilities</em>, and <em>Equity</em> to generate profits. Eventually, profits are converted to <em>Equity</em> and can be moved out of the business and into owners’ pockets. The chart of accounts guides and records that process. (And you thought accounting would be completely boring. Well, it mostly is, until you get to the last step about putting money in your pocket.)</p>\n<h3>Debits and credits</h3>\n<p>The extended accounting equation can be ungrouped and rearranged one more time:</p>\n<p><em>Assets</em> + <em>Expenses</em> = <em>Liabilities</em> + <em>Equity</em> + <em>Income</em></p>\n<p>Why bother? Because this version can help you understand the deepest mystical secrets of accounting: debits and credits. Scholars, Latin linguists, and historians disagree about origins of those terms, including who first used them, when, and in what language. Every story is thorough and convincing. But you don’t need to know any of them.</p>\n<p>You only need to know two things about debits and credits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Your natural understanding of them from dealing with banks, merchants, and others who send you bills is probably backwards. The terms they use are not from your perspective, but from your bank’s or the merchant’s. All accounting is done from the perspective of the one keeping the books. So your bank’s debit is your credit.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">For accounting purposes, <em>debit</em> means “on the left” and <em>credit</em> means “on the right.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking at the rearranged equation just above, <em>Asset</em> and <em>Expense</em> accounts are debit accounts. They are on the left side of the equal sign. <em>Liability</em>, <em>Equity</em>, and <em>Income</em> accounts are credit accounts. They are on the right. (Pretty simple, eh?)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/5/5f78e4977293ded637c68cfb5767f78e0aa31c40.png\" width=\"432\" height=\"137\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>A debit transaction increases a debit account. A credit transaction increases a credit account. The reverse is also true. Debit transactions decrease credit accounts and credit transactions decrease debit accounts. So (here comes the magic), you can determine whether a transaction is a debit or credit by whether it increases an account on the left (a debit) or the right (a credit). (Yes, you can do it the other way round, too, but that’s harder to remember.)</p>\n<p>This relationship between debits and credits and the need to keep both sides of the accounting equation in balance led more than five centuries ago to invention of double-entry accounting. Every transaction starts out as a debit or credit posted to one of the accounts in your chart of accounts. But to balance your books, it must be offset by an opposite credit or debit to a different account.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nRavi begins operating his messenger service. During the first month, he spends 2,500 from his bank account to pay operating costs. The transactions increase various <em>Expense</em> accounts on the left side of the equation. So the <em>Expense</em> accounts are debited. They also decrease his bank account, an <em>Asset</em> account, also on the left side. So the bank account is credited the same amount. (Yes, a payment from a bank account is a credit, showing that what you probably thought you knew was wrong.)<br>\n<br>At the end of the month, Ravi deposits 4,000 received from customers into the bank. This transaction increases an <em>Asset</em> account, on the left side, so the bank account is debited. To balance this, an <em>Income</em> account, on the right side, is credited with 4,000. After these changes, Ravi’s bank balance is 11,500, and his extended accounting equation is:<br>\n<br>11,500 (<em>Assets</em>) + 2,500 (<em>Expenses</em>) = 8,000 (<em>Liabilities</em>) + 2,000 (<em>Equity</em>) +4,000 (<em>Income</em>)<br>\n<br>Everything is still in balance. Ravi’s new business is profitable and growing.</p>\n</div></div>\n<p>Fortunately, when using Manager, you don’t have to remember most of this. Except for occasional journal entries, all transaction forms in Manager determine which accounts to debit and credit based on context. When faced with a decision, refer back to this Guide. And remember the rule that debits increase debit accounts and credits increase credit accounts.</p>\n<h3>Design considerations</h3>\n<p>Designing your chart of accounts is one of the most important things you do when starting a business or adopting Manager. Poor design will irritate you every day. Yet too many businesses undertake the task in a hurry. Do some research first. Check with local authorities. Consult an accountant or attorney (or both) to prevent costly problems. Several factors should influence your design:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong>Laws and regulations.</strong> You may need accounts to record taxes collected or paid. If you have employees, you need accounts for wages, contributions to retirement funds, etc.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong>Business type.</strong> Retail shops need different accounts than repair businesses, consultants different than manufacturers, and schools different than social clubs.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong>Size.</strong> Larger companies with several divisions or locations need more complex charts of accounts than smaller ones.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong>Legal organization.</strong> Partnerships need capital accounts; sole traders or proprietors may not. Trusts and corporations have different needs, too.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong>Government filings.</strong> All charts of accounts should be set up to easily support filings you will make, especially tax returns. It is much easier to post transactions to accounts that match forms than to laboriously back them out of a jumble when a filing deadline approaches.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong>Management needs.</strong> Accounts should support management decisions during the current accounting period. They should also support comparison with previous periods. But it is pointless to collect information you cannot use.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong>Permanence.</strong> Remember that once an account has been used, Manager will not let you delete it. So good practice includes accounts useful over the long term. Creating accounts for one-time events is usually poor practice. For example, accounts collecting transactions on a category of customers are better choices than accounts set up for individual customers who might never buy again. Accounts to handle expenses for events are fine, but accounts for the 2017 charity fundraiser might not be a good idea. They will clutter your financial statements in 2022.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-default\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-info-circle\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Notes</strong><br>\nSmart planning will involve adding a test business in Manager. You can experiment with typical transactions you expect to use in your business to evaluate how your chart of accounts supports your needs. Investigate whether available reports will provide information you want. You will be much happier deleting a few sample transactions or starting over with a new test business than rebuilding your real accounting records if things don’t work out.<br>\n<br>Detailed instructions for building a chart of accounts are found in <a href=\"/guides/9181\">another Guide</a>.</p>\n</div></div>",

Read <a href=\"/guides/8965\">this Guide</a> first. Consult your accountant and attorney, if necessary. Once you have a basic structure in mind, remember that Manager will automatically add some accounts based on tabs (functions) you enable. So some accounts you want may be created for you. A few accounts may be added you did not realize you needed.</p>\n<h3>Default chart of accounts</h3>\n<p>When you first create a new business in Manager, it already has a simple chart of accounts. Find the chart of accounts by clicking on the <kbd>Settings</kbd> tab in the left navigation pane, then clicking the <kbd>Chart of Accounts</kbd> icon from the display that appears:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/4/4b90a9c1aab9fd73c783bd4a494b9e7c362155d7.png\" width=\"183\" height=\"50\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"> <i class=\"fal fa-hand-point-right text-muted m-2\" style=\"font-size: 22px\"></i> <img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/b/bf7128ce9b8ab7e619e9c7924c65f67804476c65.png\" width=\"164\" height=\"50\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>Whatever you may later name your business, Manager initially assumes it is called Brilliant Industries. (It has to be named something, because Manager doesn’t show things that are not there. So if everything were blank, it would be difficult to set up your business.)</p>\n<p>Brilliant Industries’ default chart of accounts illustrates some key concepts. The Balance Sheet side includes three groups or categories in <strong>boldface</strong> type: <strong><em>Assets</em></strong>, <strong><em>Liabilities</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Equity</em></strong>. The <kbd>Edit</kbd> buttons for these groups are greyed out, because they cannot be edited. (If you read the Guide linked to above, you know that all balance sheet accounts must fall into one of these three groups.)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/3/3f1b1863dd7ba8c34c1eacb02b3474797ae1f73f.png\" width=\"506\" height=\"235\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>It also includes one account, <em>Retained earnings</em> within the <em><strong>Equity</strong></em> group. <em>Retained earnings</em> is an example of an automatically generated account. Every business needs this account. So while you can <kbd>Edit</kbd> it by renaming it or assigning it to another group, you cannot delete it. But more about that later.</p>\n<p>Brilliant Industries’ chart of accounts also includes some common (but by no means universal) accounts for the Profit and Loss Statement in <em><strong>Income</strong></em> and <em><strong>Expense</strong></em> groups. You can use these groups and accounts, rename them for other purposes, or delete them to fit your planned chart of accounts structure (to save space, not all accounts are shown below):</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/c/c295b8b8d29060dcc64ef55a88fecf412fd1302f.png\" width=\"507\" height=\"383\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-default\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-info-circle\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Note</strong><br>\nThis chart of accounts will be your starting point. You will transform it into one tailored for your legal structure, market sector, and reporting needs. As you work on it, it will be helpful to frequently check your <kbd>Summary</kbd> page to see what affect your actions are having on the display. You may even want to consider your first draft a test business, into which you can make a few sample entries to see their effects. Those few transactions can be deleted and the test business’ data file <a href=\"/guides/8890\">copied, renamed, and opened</a> as your real business.</p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Define groups first</h3>\n<p>A four-step, methodical approach will simplify building your chart of accounts. Begin by defining groups. This step is first because every account must be assigned to a group. In fact, if you neglect to assign an account, Manager will assign it for you to an automatic group, <strong><em>Uncategorized</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>A group can be subsidiary to another group. So on the Balance Sheet side of Brilliant Industries’ chart of accounts, we will create two groups, <strong><em>Current assets</em></strong> and <strong><em>Plant, equipment, and property</em></strong>, and assign them to the <strong><em>Assets</em></strong> group. We click the <kbd>New Group</kbd> button, enter the group name and choose <strong><em>Assets</em></strong> in the dropdown box:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/7/767fde06169fdea35b0a3df70549d34a1efe9444.png\" width=\"542\" height=\"207\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>We’ll do something similar under <strong><em>Liabilities</em></strong>. <strong><em>Assets</em></strong>, <strong><em>Liabilities</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Equity</em></strong> always display in that order (by long tradition). But other groups will display alphabetically unless we assign positions in the <code class=\"html\">Code</code> field. So we add <code class=\"html\">Code</code> numbers to force the display order we want. The result looks like this (note how position numbers show in grey):</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/c/c1fcdb66258b51a00dd3df50940978b96b63e7c6.png\" width=\"507\" height=\"383\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>Moving to the Profit and Loss Statement side of the chart of accounts, we take several actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Rename the <strong><em>Income</em></strong> group to <strong><em>Operating income</em></strong>.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Add a <strong><em>Cost of goods sold</em></strong> group. Since this will be a top-level group, we do not assign it to another group. We check the box for <kbd>Expenses</kbd>. This will display the group and its subsidiary accounts under the heading <strong><em>Less: Cost of goods sold</em></strong>, using positive numbers. Leaving it unchecked will display negative numbers. There is no affect on accounting behavior, only on how displays are presented.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Add a <strong><em>Non-operating income</em></strong> group, also unassigned</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Rename <strong><em>Expenses</em></strong> to <strong><em>Operating expenses</em></strong>.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Add a <strong><em>Non-operating expenses</em></strong> group, leaving it unassigned, but checking the <kbd>Expenses</kbd> box.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We use the <code class=\"html\">Code</code> field to order the groups. Our progress so far is shown below (again, some accounts have been eliminated to save space):</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/2/2a54bdfdd6edaa206103a344e5bfea204c07da94.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<h3>Add totals next</h3>\n<p>Interim subtotals and final totals are useful in accounting displays. Add them with the <kbd>New Total</kbd> button. Totals calculate a running summation of all groups above them in the chart of accounts. They are positioned with the same sequence of <code class=\"html\">Code</code> numbers as the groups and show with dashed underlines.</p>\n<p>We add two totals and adjust position numbers to accommodate them:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/5/5f317178c9f1273034c09d2b88eb4fe056d804d5.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-default\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-info-circle\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Note</strong><br>\nA bottom-line, net profit (loss) total can be added, named as desired. If one is not specifically created, Manager will automatically add one labeled <strong><em>Net profit</em></strong> when a profit exists. If the business has a loss for the reporting period, the default total will change to <strong><em>Net loss</em></strong>.</p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Activate automatic accounts</h3>\n<p>Several tabs and some settings activate accounts necessary to their functionality when they are enabled (or as soon as the first entry is made using them). If you plan to use any of these tabs (or need the accounts they activate), enable them now following procedures in <a href=\"/guides/7397\">this Guide</a>. Automatic accounts are summarized in the table below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/e/e9c6506b7f928119f5a58c475bdcb0aae3bb6cd1.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>We enable the <kbd>Customers</kbd>, <kbd>Fixed Assets</kbd>, and <kbd>Inventory Items</kbd> tabs for Brilliant Industries and make at least one entry in each tab. After reassigning accounts to appropriate groups, the Balance Sheet side of the chart of accounts looks like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/3/3241a9c874d8953abe62aba96d80ae3eee2acca2.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>And the Profit and Loss Statement side looks like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/1/19188ffd1293045cd18f45c9aa66f8c49ede9e7d.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<h3>Add other desired accounts</h3>\n<p>Finally, add any remaining accounts from your plan. Assign these to relevant groups or subgroups. For example, we will add accounts for short- and long-term loans to the Balance Sheet. And since Brilliant Industries is a sole proprietorship, we will change the name of <em>Retained earnings</em> to <em>Owner’s equity</em>. Note how the original, automatically assigned name of this account remains visible in the chart of accounts; it will not show elsewhere in the program:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/c/c169d9a82cab7b083ee1dec48d5a9be7fc466473.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>Similar additions can be made on the Profit and Loss Statement side.</p>",

But Manager’s default account structure accommodates other, more intricate business organizations. So it may encourage more complexity in the chart of accounts than necessary.</p>\n<p>Every new business created in Manager automatically includes a <em>Retained earnings</em> account, essentially the net of all inflows and outflows, adjusted for various transfers, dividends, etc., since creation of the business. In many cases, the <kbd>Capital Accounts</kbd> tab is also enabled, where members (owners of capital accounts) are designated, investment contributions and draws are recorded, and so forth. Frequently, journal entries transfer amounts between <em>Retained earnings</em> and various subaccounts of <em>Capital accounts</em>. And both <em>Retained earnings</em> and <em>Capital accounts</em> are included under the <em>Equity</em> heading on the Balance Sheet. But for the sole proprietor, things can often be simpler.</p>\n<p>As sole owner of the business, a proprietor owns the <em>Retained earnings</em> account. So no real reason for separate capital accounting exists. <em>Retained earnings</em> can be renamed as <em>Owner’s equity</em>, eliminating the need for other equity accounts. Benefits include fewer tabs enabled in Manager and reduction of equity transfers with journal entries. Unnecessary reports disappear from the <kbd>Reports</kbd> tab.

They were originally intended to support monitoring profitability by division within a single financial entity. But Manager users also find them helpful for monitoring financial performance on major projects, at different geographic locations, or on business brought in by individual sales representatives. You can employ tracking codes selectively. That is, you can apply them only to certain types of transactions or those you want to include in a specific analysis. Different tracking codes can be applied for different purposes, as well.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example 1</strong><br>\nBrilliant Industries wants to monitor profitability of its incandescent and LED lamp manufacturing divisions. It sets up two tracking codes: <em>INC</em> and <em>LED</em>. All income and expenses are designated with one code or the other. At the end of each financial period, Profit and Loss Statements are generated separately for the two divisions. Combined Profit and Loss Statements can also be created comparing performance of the two divisions.<br>\n<br><br>\n<strong>Example 2</strong><br>\nAtlas Construction assigns tracking codes to each building project by year: <em>2016-1</em>, <em>2016-2</em>, <em>2017-1</em>, etc. Transactions related to a single project are tagged with appropriate tracking codes. Those pertaining to the business in general are left uncoded. Profit and Loss Statements can be generated for individual projects or the entire company. If necessary, Atlas could designate separate lists of expenses and accounts on which tracking codes would be used for distinct project types. Concrete projects might have tracking codes applied on subcontractor labor, while internally performed electrical projects might have tracking codes applied on wages.</p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Creating tracking codes</h3>\n<p>In the <kbd>Settings</kbd> tab, click on <kbd>Tracking Codes</kbd>, then <kbd>New Tracking Code</kbd>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/f/f89b029c45010c2ed3d05a6b221ffe31ee305124.png\" width=\"217\" height=\"50\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"> <strong><i class=\"fal fa-hand-point-right text-muted m-2\" style=\"font-size: 22px\"></i></strong> <img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/5/51d96ac2d4eb00b3d675a432ac34b098a23e41bf.png\" width=\"144\" height=\"50\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"> <strong><i class=\"fal fa-hand-point-right text-muted m-2\" style=\"font-size: 22px\"></i></strong> <img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/c/ca85ac1751def21af200dc16bc8b5b90ea018d97.png\" width=\"264\" height=\"50\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>For purposes of illustration, asume you want to track three divisions: Alfa, Beta and Gamma.

Those are explained in <a href=\"/guides/10411\">another Guide</a>.</p>\n</div></div>\n<p>Earlier versions of Manager included many non-essential fields on transaction entry forms. This practice took up unnecessary screen space and added needless complexity to the program. Upon update to the current version, any non-essential fields with content are converted automatically to custom fields with the same labels. So no data is lost. Now, entry screens can contain only information you desire or the program requires. And you have the option to purge unnecessary data from old records.</p>\n<p>Custom fields are unique to the tab, form, account, or item for which you create them. Fields created for one form are not automatically available on other forms. This separation helps you customize forms without unnecessarily cluttering others. On the other hand, fields created for accounts and items may be available on multiple forms or displays where those accounts or items are used. Regardless of where they are created, though, custom fields are not available in situations where they would be pointless.</p>\n<p>Just as custom fields do not automatically appear on other forms, contents entered in a field for one transaction do not automatically appear in a field for a related transaction, even if the fields have the same label. However, if a transaction containing custom fields is <a href=\"/guides/7262\">copied to</a> another type transaction for which custom fields with identical labels have been created, contents of the custom fields will be transferred.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-default\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-info-circle\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Note</strong><br>\nIf default content for the destination form has been set under <kbd>Form Defaults</kbd> in the <kbd>Settings</kbd> tab, content from the source form will override default content.</p>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example 1</strong><br>\nYou create a custom field, <code class=\"html\">Delivery route</code>, for sales invoices to help plan daily delivery schedules.

You can create one from scratch after clicking the <kbd>New Theme</kbd> button or <kbd>View</kbd> an existing theme and <kbd>Copy to</kbd> <em>New Theme</em>.</p>\n<p>Let’s adapt the built-in, default theme and call our new theme <em>Plain (custom)</em>. When opened for editing, notice how lines 18-21 contain the following code:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"html\">{% for field in fields %}\n&lt;div style=\"font-weight: bold\"&gt;{{ field.label }}&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=\"margin-bottom: 10px\"&gt;{{ field.text }}&lt;/div&gt;\n{% endfor %}\n</code></pre>\n<p>These 4 lines are responsible for showing transaction dates, reference numbers, etc., all of which are elements of an array named <code class=\"html\">fields</code> that is separately defined for each transaction type. If you want to show content of your custom field below these basic fields, insert the following two lines <strong>after</strong> <code class=\"html\">{% endfor %}</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"html\">&lt;div style=\"font-weight: bold\"&gt;Some Custom Field&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=\"margin-bottom: 10px\"&gt;{{ custom_fields[\"Some Custom Field\"] }}&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>You will end up with:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"html\">{% for field in fields %}\n&lt;div style=\"font-weight: bold\"&gt;{{ field.label }}&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=\"margin-bottom: 10px\"&gt;{{ field.text }}&lt;/div&gt;\n{% endfor %}\n&lt;div style=\"font-weight: bold\"&gt;Some Custom Field&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=\"margin-bottom: 10px\"&gt;{{ custom_fields[\"Some Custom Field\"] }}&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-default\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-info-circle\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Note</strong><br>\nWhen adding lines, substitute the actual label of your custom field for <code class=\"html\">Some Custom Field</code>.</p>\n</div></div>\n<p><kbd>Create</kbd> or <kbd>Update</kbd> your custom theme. Edit the transaction form to which you want to apply your custom theme by checking the <code class=\"html\">Custom theme</code> box and selecting your theme:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/f/fe6184fad9757dba8b612cc33e2cdaf98ad1b907.png\" alt=\"02%20AM\" width=\"362\" height=\"83\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>When you view your transaction, your custom field will show below the basic fields in the header:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/d/d55632df3a8d5ca94ba8b58d7a43f0cb1130cd3a.png\" alt=\"L8BgSh1\" width=\"308\" height=\"373\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<h3>Suppress the duplicate custom field</h3>\n<p>You will notice your custom field now shows twice. The first place is in the heading, where you just added it. The second is at the bottom of the form where custom fields normally appear. To hide the second appearance, go back to edit your custom theme and find the following lines:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"html\">{% for field in custom_fields %}\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n        &lt;td colspan=\"99\"&gt;\n            &lt;div style=\"font-weight: bold; padding-top: 20px\"&gt;{{ field.label }}&lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;div&gt;{{ field.text | newline_to_br }}&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n{% endfor %}\n</code></pre>\n<p>After <code class=\"html\">{% for field in custom_fields %}</code> insert this line:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"html\">{% if field.label == 'Some Custom Field' %}{% continue %}{% endif %}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So you will have:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"html\">{% for field in custom_fields %}\n{% if field.label == 'Some Custom Field' %}{% continue %}{% endif %}\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n        &lt;td colspan=\"99\"&gt;\n            &lt;div style=\"font-weight: bold; padding-top: 20px\"&gt;{{ field.label }}&lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;div&gt;{{ field.text | newline_to_br }}&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n{% endfor %}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will cause the program to bypass your custom field when looping through and displaying any others you may have in the <code class=\"html\">custom_fields</code> array.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-default\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-info-circle\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Note</strong><br>\nWhen adding the line, substitute the actual label of your custom field for <code class=\"html\">Some Custom Field</code>.</p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Add conditional logic</h3>\n<p>If customization is to be applied only in certain situations, you need to add conditional logic to your theme. For example, suppose you have defined two custom fields, one for a <code class=\"html\">Customer Reference</code> number on sales invoices, the other for a <code class=\"html\">Supplier Reference</code> number on purchase invoices. But you want to insert whichever is appropriate for a transaction at hand using the same custom theme. You can insert the following code in the appropriate section of the theme:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"html\">{% if custom_fields[\"Customer Reference\"] %}\n&lt;div style=\"font-weight: bold; padding-top: 10px\"&gt;Customer Reference # : {{ custom_fields[\"Customer Reference\"] }}&lt;/div&gt;\n{% endif %}\n\n{% if custom_fields[\"Supplier Reference\"] %}\n&lt;div style=\"font-weight: bold; padding-top: 10px\"&gt;Supplier Reference # : {{ custom_fields[\"Supplier Reference\"] }}&lt;/div&gt;\n{% endif %}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The program will test all custom fields incorporated in the form as it loops through them to see if they are <code class=\"html\">Customer Reference</code> or <code class=\"html\">Supplier Reference</code>. If one is present, its label and field content will be displayed. Otherwise, execution of theme code will continue without action.</p>",

Such defaults can edited on a transaction-by-transaction basis. When a form has a financial impact, such as a receipt, sales invoice, or debit note, amounts contributing to the untaxed sub-total are posted to appropriate income or expense accounts. Calculated taxes are posted to <em>Tax payable</em>, where they offset one another according to whether they are being paid or received.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-warning\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-exclamation-triangle\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Caution</strong><br>\nIf the tax scheme in your jurisdiction does not offset taxes paid against taxes collected, <strong>do not use tax codes on your purchases</strong>. Include tax in the unit price of every line item, where it will add to the expense of the item.</p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Tax methodology for tax-exclusive pricing</h3>\n<p>Tax-exclusive pricing is the most intuitive. A sub-total is calculated for all line items subject to a specific tax code; then, the sub-total is multiplied by the appropriate percentage to obtain the tax amount. The tax amount is added to the sub-total to give the total. If more than one tax code is applied on a transaction, separate calculations are performed before adding together all sub-totals and tax amounts for a total.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nYou buy an item for 1,000 plus 10% goods and services tax. If the amount of 1,000 is tax-exclusive, 10% tax is added to it, increasing the total to 1,100. The tax shows as an addition when you create a purchase invoice:<br>\n<br><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/8/884ed758bd31fbfe0a0a945b7bd1b66907eaff4e.png\" alt=\"07 PM\" width=\"395\" height=\"115\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"><br>\n<br><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/4/479ee8bc888a6193c691cf5819e36359c42f32e0.png\" alt=\"36 PM\" width=\"265\" height=\"177\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"><br>\n<br>Since the transaction is a purchase, 100.00 is debited to <em>Tax payable</em>, where it offsets amounts you have collected from customers on behalf of your tax authority. The 1,000.00 sub-total is debited to the designated expense account. The entire 1,100 is credited to <em>Accounts payable</em>.<br>\n<br>If this were a sales invoice instead of a purchase invoice, entries would be similar, but results would be reversed. Manager would credit 100.00 to <em>Tax payable</em> and 1,100 to an income account. It would debit <em>Accounts receivable</em> by 1,100.</p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Tax methodology for tax-inclusive pricing</h3>\n<p>When entering tax-inclusive prices, the situation is opposite. Manager calculates what tax-exclusive unit price would have produced the tax-inclusive amount <strong>after</strong> tax was added. The program does this for every line item. This calculation is:</p>\n<p><code class=\"html\">Tax-exclusive price = Tax-inclusive price / (1 + Tax rate)</code></p>\n<p>Thus, both effective unit prices and calculated taxes are lower for tax-inclusive pricing, assuming identical inputs.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nYou make the same purchase as in the previous example, using a payment form, but pricing is tax-inclusive.

At the same time, it buys and installs a package rack in the truck. The rack costs 100.00, inclusive of 10% tax. Brilliant posts the tax-inclusive payment to its <em>Motor vehicle expenses</em> account, applying the 10% tax code.<br>\n<br>Brilliant’s accountant later determines that local tax law requires the cost of the rack, including tax, to be capitalized and depreciated as part of the cost of the truck, not taken as a current operating expense. So the rack’s full cost, including tax, must be shifted to the <em>Fixed assets</em> account. And since the tax can no longer be counted as an offsetting input tax, it must be removed from the <em>Tax payable</em> account.<br>\n<br>This oversight is corrected with a single journal entry. The transaction records a 100.00 debit to <em>Fixed assets</em> and the subaccount for the truck. No tax code is selected.

But the balance of the  <em>Motor vehicle expenses</em> account only goes down by 90.91. The remaining 9.09 is added to <em>Tax payable</em> to compensate for the input tax that can no longer be claimed. The accuracy of the <em>Motor vehicle expenses</em> account is preserved because, when the rack was originally recorded as a tax-inclusive payment, only 90.91 was posted to the expense account. (90.91 x 1.10 = 100.00)</p>\n</div></div>",

Debts can include loans you have made to others, balances due on sales invoices under <em>Accounts receivable</em>, or other assets recording money owed to you. Underlying reasons might include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Bankruptcy of the customer or debtor</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Legal disputes over contract terms</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Death or disappearance of a customer</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Termination of a business without payment of obligations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whatever the reason, a debt should only be written off when there is a reasonable and sincere belief it cannot be recovered.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-default\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-info-circle\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Note</strong><br>\nStandards may exist in your jurisdiction for when bad debts can be written off and what evidence may be required to justify the write-off.

Those should be handled with credit notes, as described in <a href=\"/guides/7425\">another Guide</a>.</p>\n<h3>Establish a <em>Bad debts</em> account</h3>\n<p>When a bad debt is written off, an asset that previously had the potential to generate income is converted to an expense. So you must choose an expense account for the write-off. Good practice is to <a href=\"/guides/9812\">add an account</a> to the <em>Expenses</em> category of your chart of accounts, naming it something like <em>Bad debts</em>. But any suitable expense account can be used.</p>\n<h3>Write off a bad debt</h3>\n<p>Use a <a href=\"/guides/9820\">journal entry</a> to write off a debt. Debit the <em>Bad debts</em> account by the amount being written off. Credit the asset account where the bad debt is recorded by the same amount.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nQuick Computer Repair previously invoiced Brilliant Industries 350.00 for computer repair services.

It makes a journal entry, debiting 350.00 to <em>Bad debts</em> and crediting the same amount to <em>Accounts receivable</em>, Brilliant’s subaccount, and the specific sales invoice:<br>\n<br><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/2/2a68bc66823f72bc29e717344a5d30349159c3a9.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n</div></div>\n<p>If the original debt was the result of a sales invoice, the journal entry leaves the income in the income account where it was first posted. This preserves a record of the economic activity. But that income is offset by the expense in the <em>Bad debt</em> account.</p>\n<h3>Adjust taxes</h3>\n<p>If the debt being written off was the result of a taxable transaction, things are more complex. You must first determine whether, under local tax law:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Tax is payable to the authority because taxable goods or services were delivered, regardless of whether they were paid for, <strong>OR</strong>\n</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Tax is not payable because the goods or services were not paid for.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Tax is payable</h5>\n<p>In the first case, debit <em>Bad debts</em> for the gross amount of the debt, including taxes. Credit the asset account where the debt is recorded by the same amount. But <strong>do not apply any tax codes</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nThe services in the prior example are subject to a 10% goods and services tax.

And 35.00 remains in <em>Tax payable</em>. Thus, Quick Computer Repair incurs a loss on the transaction of 35.00, equal to the tax it must pay on behalf of its defunct customer.</p>\n</div></div>\n<h5>Tax is not payable</h5>\n<p>In the second case, not only must the full debt be transferred to expenses, the tax liability must also be eliminated. So apply the relevant tax code to the <em>Bad debt</em> debit.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nThe journal entry includes gross amounts and applies the tax code only to the debit line:<br>\n<br><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/3/39d561a84ee3586c9cfc9af7590837687262ceed.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"><br>\n<br>Tax is removed from <em>Tax payable</em>. Both <em>Service sales - fixed rate</em> and <em>Bad debts</em> include 350.00. The final result is no tax owed to the authority and no net profit on the transaction. But both sales activity and the bad debt are recorded.</p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Reverse a write-off</h3>\n<p>Occasionally, a bad debt legitimately thought to be unrecoverable becomes recoverable, such as when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">A lost customer is located</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">A customer or debtor emerges from bankruptcy and makes good on its former debts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do not delete the write-off journal entry. Instead, place the formerly bad debt back into your assets with a reverse journal entry. This time, debit the asset account where the debt was lodged and credit <em>Bad debts</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nBrilliant Industries resumes business and notifies Quick Computer Repair it will honor its former obligations.

Such schemes free a business from the need to record and offset taxes paid against those collected. Under such schemes, a standard tax rate is applied on sales, but a lower rate is remitted to the tax authority. This lower rate is calculated on the total amount for a line item, <em>including standard tax</em>. The difference is kept by the business as additional income. Often, flat tax rates vary by business type and size, based on assumptions of average tax paid to suppliers by businesses with certain characteristics. So they must be set up as custom tax codes in Manager.</p>\n<p>To add a flat rate tax code, follow the same procedure as for any other single-rate custom tax code. (Flat rate schemes cannot be used with multi-component tax codes.) Name the tax code as you want customers to see it, normally with the standard tax rate. Check the <kbd>Flat rate</kbd> box and enter the lower rate you will pay to the tax authority:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/8/86499b478b0a8bcfafd5b317893797a400ab96d1.png\" width=\"490\" height=\"271\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>Customers will see the standard tax rate on sales invoices, and <em>Accounts receivable</em> will show the full amount as being due. But <em>Tax payable</em> will show a lesser amount. The difference will be added to the income account where the particular line item on the sales invoice is posted.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-warning\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-exclamation-triangle\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Caution</strong><br>\nWhen operating under a flat rate tax scheme, no tax code should be applied on purchases, because tax paid cannot be used to offset tax owed.

Individual tax components may be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Levied by different tax authorities</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Payable to tax authorities on different dates</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Subject to rate changes at different times</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Applicable to different customers</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Effective only for certain categories of goods or services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Basic instructions for creating multi-component custom tax codes are contained <a href=\"/guides/8901\">in another Guide</a>. Those instructions are adequate for simple situations where all components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Apply simultaneously to goods or services</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Are payable to the same authority at the same time</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Are not expected to change</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If any of these criteria does not apply, read on.</p>\n<h3>An example</h3>\n<p>This Guide uses a custom tax code with four components as an example. The overall tax code is named <em>Sales Tax 8.845%</em>. Components are levied by the state, a special transit district, the county, and the city. Percentage tax rates are as shown:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/1/1de50afcd00a8ed2a81b70f7f32f5c8f3d7204d7.png\" width=\"481\" height=\"298\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>In the simple situation outlined above, all components can be assigned to the default <em>Tax payable</em> account, which Manager creates automatically when the first tax code is entered. On a sales invoice with a line item to which this tax code applies, the applicable tax code is selected:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/8/837df679ddbd0828534c492192fb438495ed81b9.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>The resulting sales invoice lists the individual tax component amounts rather than the overall tax code:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/7/70ae243762e351f5363e138aeb703d7cca37e369.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>Assuming no other taxable transactions have been recorded yet, the <kbd>Summary</kbd> shows all taxes payable in a single account:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/d/d0296c0fbed4698741db58ab18b70b307356d066.png\" width=\"357\" height=\"26\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>The various tax reports in the <kbd>Reports</kbd> tab also group all components together. For example, the Tax Summary report includes just one line:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/8/817ded8dbdbd99e3e13b6e5277e58fe379c4759e.png\" width=\"673\" height=\"386\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>If it is necessary to determine how much of each component was collected, a calculation must be made outside Manager. For example, the state component of tax collected in the report above is the ratio of that component to the total tax rate multiplied by the tax collected, so:</p>\n<p>2.90 / 8.845 x 8.85 = 2.90</p>\n<p>In this single-transaction example, that result matches the amount charged on the only sales invoice. (When more taxable transactions are recorded, the prorated portion is not so obvious, of course.) But this is cumbersome. Manager can streamline the process.</p>\n<h3>Establishing separate tax payable accounts</h3>\n<p>To keep track of individual tax components when they are payable to different authorities or on different schedules, create  separate tax payable accounts for each. In the <kbd>Settings</kbd> tab, select <kbd>Chart of Accounts</kbd>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/5/57d389d7458df073f143738af5281bf22f998b3e.png\" width=\"204\" height=\"50\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"> <strong><i class=\"fal fa-hand-point-right text-muted m-2\" style=\"font-size: 22px\"></i></strong> <img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/f/fdcca4650dae0928af4ed8c14fd46ad047d38568.png\" width=\"166\" height=\"50\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>On the Balance Sheet side, click <kbd>New Account</kbd>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/b/b9cdee3466264a0c1a126e3c235286b169a63a3f.png\" width=\"350\" height=\"128\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>Enter a name for a tax payable account for the first tax component. In this example, account codes are used to order accounts. The default <em>Tax payable</em> account has the code 2500, so the state sales tax component is given 2501. Place the account in the <em>Liabilities</em> group (or a subgroup under that). Leave the <code class=\"html\">Tax Code</code> field and <code class=\"html\">Control account</code> checkbox blank. Click <kbd>Create</kbd> to finish:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/1/14e7c168927bbeefcfb8d7491e211e25e646f5ed.png\" alt=\"11%20AM\" width=\"545\" height=\"319\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>Repeat the process for the other tax components. Then return to <kbd>Settings</kbd> <i class=\"fal fa-hand-point-right text-muted m-2\" style=\"font-size: 22px\"></i> <kbd>Tax Codes</kbd> and edit the tax code by assigning each component to its matching tax payable account:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/9/97e6220ec133261f1a725b72b60cbfabd38067be.png\" width=\"499\" height=\"314\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>Now, the <kbd>Summary</kbd> shows a breakdown of how much tax is owed to each authority:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/d/ddddc9bfdbce1887ac593bedb549cbfa623bef40.png\" width=\"331\" height=\"161\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>Although the default <em>Tax Payable</em> account remains empty, it cannot be deleted. It is a control account created when the first tax code was defined, but is now functioning as a pass-through account. Required payments to various tax authorities can now be determined from their appropriate accounts, eliminating the need to calculate prorated shares of the overall tax code.</p>\n<p>At the present time, tax reports in Manager cannot break out individual components.</p>\n<h3>Handling different taxable situations</h3>\n<p>For situations where all tax components do not apply, create new tax codes to match. In the example, goods and services delivered outside the city are exempt from city sales tax, but still subject to the other three. And food sales are exempt by law from the transit sales tax. So two new tax codes are created in the same manner as the first:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">City-exempt sales tax 4.985%</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Transit-exempt sales tax 7.745%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Component account assignments are made to the same four tax payable accounts, as applicable. Codes would also be created for any other feasible combinations of customer, location, and applicability. Every tax code is, in effect, a subset of the basic, four-component code originally created. Transactions can be designated for proper tax treatment based on identity or location of the customer, type of goods, etc. If necessary, tax codes can be selected on a line item basis within any transaction form.</p>\n<p>After the new tax codes are in place, a second sales invoice for the same services to a  customer outside the city is summarized on a new line on the Tax Summary, reflecting the lower tax rate:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/f/fff41314914eb761738d2133c0867f18a12ccc3b.png\" width=\"670\" height=\"460\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>But the various components are posted to the same tax payable accounts as before (reflecting the two transactions entered so far):</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/3/3b50f9a780f393cf1c8f285fc3c02a8450a8b014.png\" width=\"330\" height=\"156\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<h3>Changing component tax rates</h3>\n<p>When a component of a tax code changes, a completely new tax code must be created. Good practice is to archive the obsolete tax code.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-warning\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-exclamation-triangle\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Caution</strong><br>\nNever edit components of a tax code that has already been used for any transaction. All previous transactions using that code would be retroactively modified.</p>\n</div></div>\n<p>Returning to the example, assume the state sales tax component increases to 3.5% mid-year. A new tax code is created and the obsolete one renamed and archived. Subsequently, a third sales invoice for identical services to a customer within the city is issued. The resulting Tax Summary shows all three rates used during the accounting period:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/5/59883e26249da44fba00222e06cbe3d71ca95972.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<h3>Paying individual tax authorities</h3>\n<p>Rather than paying off all or a portion of a single <em>Tax payable</em> account, payments can be made to tax authorities for a single component, posting the bank or cash transaction to the appropriate component’s tax payable account. Assume, for example, the transit tax is remitted. Only the relevant account need be zeroed out. The Balance Sheet shows the amounts remaining to be paid to other tax authorities:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/5/538b5fed3e3d3d23b6652cafa855bc9cbe8c464f.png\" width=\"319\" height=\"157\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>",

    "html": "<h1 class=\"display-4 mb-4\" style=\"font-size: 2.5rem\">Reverse charge VAT (Value Added Tax)</h1><p><strong>Reverse charged VAT</strong> is used in some territories to collect tax on purchases from suppliers who are not subject to the tax authority’s jurisdiction. Usually, that means reverse charged VAT applies to imported goods or services that do not pass through customs.</p>\n<p>Often, this is justified by explaining that foreign entities will be spared the need to register or make tax filings with the authority. But the method also eliminates the need for a tax authority to obtain filings and remittances from entities outside its control. Thus, reverse charged VAT improves tax collection.</p>\n<p>Basically, reverse charging of VAT transfers responsibility for assessing and collecting VAT from a seller to a purchaser. Instead of being assessed VAT by and paying VAT to your supplier, you assess VAT on yourself and remit it directly to the tax authority.</p>\n<p>However, since typical VAT regimens offset VAT paid on purchases against VAT collected on sales, the result is no tax actually paid on goods or services subject to reverse charged VAT. Think of this as simultaneously claiming the tax you would have paid the supplier and reporting the same tax the supplier would have received from you in a normal situation. Since those amounts are the same, no money changes hands for VAT.</p>\n<p>So why implement such a scheme? And if no money is due to anyone, why not use a regular, zero-percent tax code? As mentioned above, reverse charged VAT improves tax compliance. But data submitted to the tax authority in connection with reverse charged VAT is also used to track the volume of trade with other jurisdictions for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Revenue sharing</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Tax treaty enforcement and compliance</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Economic performance monitoring</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Tax rate analysis and adjustment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The use of reverse charged VAT tax codes ensures that total sales volumes are still reported and can be categorized according to their proper tax codes.</p>\n<h3>Set up a reverse charged VAT tax code</h3>\n<p>Reverse charged VAT is accounted for in Manager using a custom tax code. General procedures for creating custom tax codes are contained in <a href=\"/guides/8901\">another Guide</a>. Read it first.</p>\n<p>When creating the new custom tax code, give it an informative name and select <em>0%</em> in the dropdown <code class=\"html\">Tax rate</code> field.

Access them in the <kbd>Reports</kbd> tab in the left navigation pane:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/6/684939800096876437d21aacba406e5cb57957aa.png\" width=\"181\" height=\"52\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<h3>Enabling reports</h3>\n<p>In general, reports are available to users whenever <a href=\"/guides/8865\">tabs related to them are enabled</a>. By default, when a new business is added in Manager, a few tabs are already enabled, so a few reports common to all businesses can be generated:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/3X/f/d/fd1457d78c651038792d370d820b99f1359bbf99.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>As more tabs are enabled, more reports are available. For example, when <kbd>Customers</kbd> and <kbd>Suppliers</kbd> tabs are enabled, aging reports and statements can be produced:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/5/5dbb234b762162454c56cd2aab3f50ecb8fd4547.png\" alt=\"57%20AM\" width=\"371\" height=\"354\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>Reports are available related to tax codes, fixed assets, inventory, expense claims, capital accounts, and other aspects of accounting.</p>\n<h3>Creating reports</h3>\n<p>Begin creating a new report by clicking on the report’s name under the <kbd>Reports</kbd> tab. Then, in most cases, click <kbd>New Report</kbd>. (One exception is <kbd>Custom Reports</kbd>, which is not covered by this Guide.) Depending on which report is being created, various fields will appear. Some have default content, shown in grey. This content can be overwritten to customize a report. Other fields, such as dates, may be required. Some reports offer options for adding explanatory information, showing account codes, or excluding zero balances. For example, a new Cash Summary entry screen is shown below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/2/2638022a82a0cd326b7aea0ec96138917d5279aa.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>For some reports, comparative columns can be added. These can be useful for comparing current performance with past accounting periods. Note that columns can be named and their order adjusted by dragging the double-arrow symbols to the left of column names up or down. The top-listed column will appear at the left on the report in <strong>bold type</strong>. Other comparative columns will appear to the right of that column:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/c/cbf6586a3226ae5a1d84f6b9cec9600723cbcafb.png\" width=\"295\" height=\"370\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>The foregoing setup produces the following Balance Sheet:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/a/a92f26c13c7cdd8f9cebd902f201599b2947fe86.png\" width=\"684\" height=\"434\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>Occasionally, an option exists to set the end or as-of date as <em>Today</em>. When that choice is selected, the report will always be up to date when viewed. A custom date can also be entered:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/4/42a44ab3a022349489eba466739a86f73e455f02.png\" width=\"149\" height=\"226\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"> <strong>OR</strong> <img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/3/3b46f2963ff02a5740cde52f3a42a3c2fd4e84ac.png\" width=\"229\" height=\"159\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>Reports that are simple lists can be exported for further manipulation in a spreadsheet by clicking <img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/7/71a300279e16458853e24d2106c60d246e6dc13f.png\" width=\"49\" height=\"24\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"> at the bottom of the screen.</p>\n<h3>Saving and editing reports</h3>\n<p>Most reports can be saved. (<a href=\"/guides/7022\">Customer</a> and <a href=\"/guides/7023\">Supplier</a> Statements cannot, because they change according to the as-of date or period specified.) Every report that can be is automatically saved when <kbd>Create</kbd> is clicked. Frequently used reports are then readily available without creating new ones. In fact, it may be convenient to define common reports for a full accounting period (such as through the end of a year). A report defined that way will be accurate through the current date whenever viewed, until the end of the accounting period. Of course, the displayed end date may be wrong.</p>\n<p>Saved reports can be edited after clicking the <kbd>Edit</kbd> button to the left of a report in the list:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/7/7ad12c2c88dec29315bd88a7b5ac8e3831b06a0a.png\" width=\"490\" height=\"156\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>Click <kbd>Update</kbd> after editing to save the revised report. Saved reports can also be deleted when no longer needed by clicking <kbd>Delete</kbd> at the bottom of the edit screen.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-default\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-info-circle\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Note</strong><br>\nManager does not actually save reports as documents or files. It stores definitions of reports, including necessary dates, titles, column headings, etc. When a saved report is viewed, Manager actually creates it in real time from the stored definition. Therefore, a deleted report can always be recreated, because Manager never deletes the underlying transactions, only the information needed for a particular display. And if report formats are improved as Manager is updated, all saved reports will automatically be updated, too.</p>\n</div></div>",

Again, all figures are clickable.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nNorthwind prepares a report for the same three-year period to analyze sales results by item:<br>\n<br><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/a/a61ade36175d7da1c46ba5c0863c192b23003486.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Sales Invoice Totals by Custom Field</h3>\n<p>The final sales invoice report offers great flexibility to fit your business needs by leveraging custom fields for sales invoice analysis. The key is to first define and populate <a href=\"/guides/8941\">custom fields</a> that support your sales analysis goals. The report can incorporate sales invoice totals based on the following types of custom fields:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Sales invoice</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Sales invoice line item</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Customer</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Inventory item</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Non-inventory item</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When a new report is defined, available custom fields are displayed by type:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/b/be84d67051104a480dfcff90676e1e706982cc3c.png\" alt=\"50 AM\" width=\"329\" height=\"315\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>As with the other two reports described above, comparative columns can be set up, results are sorted in descending order of sales in the primary column, and all figures are clickable.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nNorthwind has sales associates who earn commission on generated sales each month. So it needs a report giving sales invoice totals by sales associate to calculate their commissions.<br>\n<br>It creates a custom field for sales invoices called <code class=\"html\">Sales associate</code>, and every time it creates an invoice, it selects the sales associate who closed the sale.<br>\n<br>It creates a new report, specifying three monthly time frames and selecting the <code class=\"html\">Sales associate</code> custom field:<br>\n<br><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/5/52299762ae60db5b6dcf66f5c77ff1bce07c12c8.png\" alt=\"v1LcIo0\" width=\"495\" height=\"330\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"><br>\n<br>The report will show sales invoice totals by sales associate (not by customer or item as with the previous reports):<br>\n<br><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/f/f425b688f515a2ec6c0e417f9d0efd5a33c9e78f.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n</div></div>\n<p>You can accomplish more with this report. For example, if you have thousands of customers, it may not be very useful to see invoice totals by customer because the report would be so long. Perhaps it would be more useful to see invoice totals by country. Likewise, if your inventory is large, it might be helpful to create custom fields for inventory items (<em>e. g.</em>, group, material, type, brand, etc.) and view totals by those custom fields.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Examples</strong><br>\nNorthwind adds a custom field, <code class=\"html\">Country</code>, to its customer definitions. Now, it can generate reports by country:<br>\n<br><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/b/bb0784c1ffd92afbc626099be762b09ba4df5878.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"><br>\n<br>It also defines a custom field, <code class=\"html\">Brand</code>, for inventory items and limits choices to a few popular brands. Now it can see how those brands perform relative to one another:<br>\n<br><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/c/c3c474de6c3aade96089025738d391ce57bd1b16.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-default\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-info-circle\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Note</strong><br>\nCustom field content is not mandatory. Sales invoices that do not contain anything in the custom field selected will be left out of the report. So, if Northwind sells other brands of appliances, but only wants to track the five in the example above, it can do so. Results for items with different brands will be available in other reports.</p>\n</div></div>",

You can keep going to add as many periods as you like.</p>\n<h3>Create a Multi-step P&amp;L</h3>\n<p>Manager also supports custom income &amp; expense groups, sub-groups (unlimited levels) and custom totals which can cater for entities with more complex layout requirements. If you want your P&amp;L to show <em>gross profit</em>, <em>operating profit</em>, <em>net profit before income tax</em> in addition to custom sub-groups, you can re-organize your <em>Chart of Accounts</em> to reflect your business requirements with ease.

As long as you’re connected to the Internet, this option should always work. If it doesn’t, and you are using the latest version, there could be a bug which should be reported to us on the <a href=\"https://forum.manager.io/\">Forum</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have checked the box to <code class=\"html\">Use custom SMTP server</code>, uncheck the option and click <kbd>Update</kbd>. Then test the email function again. If your emails start working, the problem is with your custom SMTP server settings. Your <code class=\"html\">Username</code>, <code class=\"html\">Host</code>, <code class=\"html\">Port</code> or <code class=\"html\">Password</code> could be invalid. You need to check with your SMTP provider to determine the correct settings.</p>\n<p>Currently, Manager doesn’t support port <em>465</em>. So try different port, such as <em>587</em>. Most SMTP servers will support both ports, so this is generally not an issue.</p>\n<p>If you encounter other problems, post them in a <strong>new topic</strong> on the Forum.

The options are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">A contra asset account, meaning the credit card will be displayed under <em>Assets</em> on the Balance Sheet, but normally with a negative value until paid off</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">A liability account, indicating the company owes money to the credit card issuer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The two approaches are financially equivalent, so both are equally correct. This choice is a matter of personal preference.</p>\n<h3>Create a credit card account</h3>\n<p>Regardless of which option will be used, the credit card account must be created first under the <kbd>Bank Accounts</kbd> tab. A credit card account is considered a bank account because it can be used as a medium of exchange and is maintained by a financial institution rather than the business.</p>\n<p>Enable the <kbd>Bank Accounts</kbd> tab and create the credit card account as described <a href=\"/guides/11367\">here</a>. You may wish to <a href=\"/guides/8941\">add custom fields</a> to your bank accounts to record things like account numbers and financial institutions. You can also <a href=\"/guides/7128\">assign account code numbers</a> to control the order in which accounts are displayed or match them to an overall numbering scheme for your chart of accounts.</p>\n<p>The credit card will now be displayed in your <kbd>Bank Accounts</kbd> tab along with other bank accounts. Because most transactions will post to this account from <kbd>New Payment</kbd> transactions, the account’s balance will usually be negative. Only refunds or payments to the credit card will move its balance in a positive direction:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/c/ce5619ea496c04b6719dc6b44158ab1b43a5e858.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-default\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-info-circle\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Note</strong><br>\nIf a credit card has a balance on your start date, enter the balance as a negative number under <kbd>Starting Balances</kbd> in the <kbd>Settings</kbd> tab. See <a href=\"/guides/15718\">this Guide</a> for more information about starting balances.</p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Contra asset option</h3>\n<p>To set up the credit card as a contra asset account, leave the control account field at the default option of <em>Cash at bank</em> when you create it:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/2/2b8f003ad8f891fba064176617aca52803049093.png\" alt=\"24 PM\" width=\"319\" height=\"65\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>On your Balance Sheet, the balance of the credit card account will reduce the balance of the control account, <em>Cash at bank</em>.</p>\n<p>The advantage of the contra asset option is your <kbd>Summary</kbd> page and Balance Sheet show at a glance how much cash you have to spend that is not already obligated. The disadvantage is credit card balances are not so visible.</p>\n<h3>Liability option</h3>\n<p>To set up the credit card as a liability account, you must first <a href=\"/guides/9256\">create a custom control account</a> in your chart of accounts. Give it a name like <em>Current liabilities</em> if you want it to include other short-term obligations. Or just name it <em>Credit cards</em>. Indicate the custom control account is made up of bank accounts:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/8/8e9070a7564619dc80126dd0f77db357cf8fc61b.png\" alt=\"08 PM\" width=\"539\" height=\"349\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>Go back to the <kbd>Bank Accounts</kbd> tab and <kbd>Edit</kbd> your credit card account by assigning it to the custom control account just created:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/b/b56a64195fbeac3c0e306a817f0a1806595e1484.png\" alt=\"31 PM\" width=\"324\" height=\"68\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>Now, the balance of your credit card account will show under <em>Liabilities</em> on your Balance Sheet:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/e/ef1c8ec8a2602217e62fcdffb5da90a4c28d066e.png\" alt=\"36 PM\" width=\"488\" height=\"121\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>Notice that while the credit card balance will still show in the <kbd>Bank Accounts</kbd> tab as negative, it will appear as a positive number under <em>Liabilities</em> on the <kbd>Summary</kbd> page, because <em>Liabilities</em> are automatically subtracted from <em>Assets</em> on that display.</p>\n<p>The advantage of the liability option is credit card balances show on your <kbd>Summary</kbd> page and Balance Sheet as amounts owed. This may be more useful if you do not always pay off the full credit card statement balance. This option clearly separates what you have (assets) from what you owe (liabilities). The disadvantage is a quick glance at the <kbd>Summary</kbd> may suggest you have more unobligated cash than you really do.</p>",

The confusion typically arises because an inter account transfer is really two separate transactions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">A <strong>withdrawal</strong> from the source account (a payment)</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">A <strong>deposit</strong> to the destination account (a receipt)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When a transfer is recorded in Manager’s <kbd>Inter Account Transfers</kbd> tab, the program combines the two transactions on a single entry screen, then invisibly records them to their separate bank accounts. But when transactions are imported via an electronic bank statement, the imported statement includes only one or the other transaction, never both.</p>\n<p>Moreover, whether posting any bank transaction to an account manually or by <a href=\"/guides/9243\">bank rule</a>, receipts and payments cannot be posted to <em>Cash at bank</em> and a specific bank account. (Without explaining all the details here, that would result in duplication of transactions.) Therefore, receipts and payments that are part of an inter account transfer must be processed via a clearing account.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-default\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-info-circle\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Note</strong><br>\nClearing accounts are used to temporarily lodge transactions that will eventually be posted to regular accounts. Amounts are debited and credited in offset to one another, sometimes almost simultaneously, but other times days apart, after some aspect of a transaction is cleared or appears on a statement. Normally, the debits and credits cancel each other, so the balance of the clearing account returns to zero when all activity is complete. Using a clearing account is like temporarily storing cash in your pocket until you can transfer it to your wallet.</p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Set up the clearing account</h3>\n<p>Theoretically, since the net effect of an inter account transfer leaves the clearing account with a zero (or undisturbed prior) balance, any account could be used. But that would temporarily distort the balance of the selected account until the transaction fully clears.</p>\n<p>Likewise, if a clearing account exists for some other purpose, it could be used. But good accounting practice uses separate clearing accounts for different purposes so their histories show distinct types of transactions.</p>\n<p>The imported statement entry relating to transfers between financial accounts needs to be processed with a Bank Rule via a clearing account. (Or edit the entry to the clearing account)</p>\n<p>Under <kbd>Chart of Accounts</kbd> in the <kbd>Settings</kbd> tab, <a href=\"/guides/9812\">add the clearing account</a>.

Or, an allowance may have been earned without the exchange of money.</p>\n<p>Paying or clearing an expense claim is a separate, second transaction. When directly reimbursing a Payer, payment from a bank or cash account is required.</p>\n<p>Lastly, if you need a report showing how much the business owes and has paid to everyone who has filed an expense claim, you must define all Payers in the Expense Claims Payers category, even though they may already be defined as Members or Employees. Otherwise, status information will be scattered in different reports.</p>",

You want any credits to be automatically applied to invoices, so you are not trying to collect from a customer more than is really owed to you and you don’t pay suppliers more than you really owe them. For example, if a customer has a credit balance of $100 due to a credit note, Manager will remember this until the next invoice is issued to that customer and will automatically apply the $100 credit to it without your having to keep track of it. But if you are certain the customer or supplier didn’t have a credit balance, such an automatic credit allocation indicates something has been recorded incorrectly.</p>\n<p>In the example above, the problem is easy to diagnose. A bank receipt was applied to the sales invoice. You can look up that receipt in Manager, determine who it was from, and decide whether an error was made. Or, the customer may have simply overpaid its account, in which case everything is as it should be.</p>\n<p>But suppose you know this customer didn’t have any credit with your company, and the mini-statement on the invoice refers to something like a starting balance or a credit note.

In simple terms, buyers are required to withhold a portion of the balance due on invoices and pay that portion directly to the tax authority. Then, either the buyer or the tax authority provides certification of payment of withheld amounts to the seller. The seller reduces subsequent payments of its tax liabilities by amounts already paid on its behalf by buyers.</p>\n<p>Withholding tax may be a form of advance payment of income taxes, value added taxes, goods and service taxes, or some combination of these and other types of tax. Because the entire process involves both buyers and sellers, Manager supports withholding tax accounting through both its sales invoice and purchase invoice processes, though procedures are somewhat different.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-default\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-info-circle\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Notes</strong><br>\nAs implemented in Manager, withholding tax <strong>does not</strong> refer to deductions on payslips of taxes due from employees. These are referred to as <code class=\"html\">Payslip Deduction Items</code> and are explained in <a href=\"/guides/9667\">another Guide</a>.<br>\n<br>Withholding tax cannot be applied on cash receipts or payments, because the full amount of the transaction must be recorded. Further, cash receipts cannot be associated with individual customers’ subaccounts as withholding tax must.</p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Sales invoice process</h3>\n<p>The sales invoice process applies when your business is the seller and you send sales invoices to your customers.</p>\n<p><strong>Activating withholding tax accounts</strong></p>\n<p>Withholding tax functionality for sales invoices does not require activation of any new tabs.

(Remember, withholding tax is not an expense of your company, so it should not affect other financial results. You are only acting as collection agent for the tax authority of amounts that will eventually be due from the supplier.)</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong>Recording tax withheld</strong> for later remittance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These two goals mean you need at least two line items on the purchase invoice. First, record purchased line items at their full costs, using as many lines as necessary, just as though no withholding tax was involved. Post these line items to the same accounts you normally would.</p>\n<p>Second, add a line item for withholding tax at the amount indicated on your supplier’s sales invoice. <strong>Enter the withholding tax as a negative quantity</strong> so it reduces the balance due on the purchase invoice.

A purchase invoice can be created directly from the sales quote without re-entering information. When viewing the sales quote, select <em>New Purchase Invoice</em> from the <kbd>Copy to</kbd> dropdown box:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/3/38206eae2e9c00ba9e78b6685d2eab15512193eb.png\" alt=\"51 PM\" width=\"480\" height=\"190\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<p>A purchase invoice entry screen appears. After the actual supplier is selected, a purchase invoice is created, carrying forward relevant information.</p>\n<h3>From sales orders</h3>\n<p>If an internal sales order was created in response to a customer’s order, but items to fulfill it were purchased from outside suppliers, a purchase invoice representing the supplier’s sales invoice can be created directly from the sales order. This is useful when no purchase order was created in Manager. (If one was, create the purchase invoice from the purchase order, as described above.)</p>\n<p>Exactly as when creating a purchase invoice from a sales quote, select <em>New Purchase Invoice</em> from the <kbd>Copy to</kbd> dropdown box:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/9/9e000fdab0a862277a5afc33926a5ae36ab24201.png\" alt=\"24 PM\" width=\"482\" height=\"164\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<h3>From your own sales invoices</h3>\n<p>Another method for creating a purchase invoice is from your own customer sales invoice. This option might be useful when a business keeps records of goods and services from a supplier and does not require a sales invoice from the supplier. Instead, the business assumes it must pay its supplier for what it has invoiced its customer.</p>\n<p>Again, select <em>New Purchase Invoice</em> from the <kbd>Copy to</kbd> dropdown box on the sales invoice:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/6/6a9b75f38e607cff77540bad0fb293a2ab190fcd.png\" alt=\"18 PM\" width=\"490\" height=\"243\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n<h3>From goods receipts</h3>\n<p>A final method is from a goods receipt. This method can be helpful when suppliers send merchandise for inspection prior to issuing an invoice or automatically replenish stock based on contractual terms.</p>\n<p>As with other methods, select <em>New Purchase Invoice</em> from the <kbd>Copy to</kbd> dropdown box on the goods receipt:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/d/db5f260567d9dd72e73a30afc589fff228cb2f21.png\" alt=\"06%20PM\" width=\"441\" height=\"85\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>",

Manual allocation can be used in all cases. Automatic distribution can be used under limited circumstances and includes drawbacks some users (or their accountants or auditors) may not like.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Manual allocation of separate freight-in charges</em></strong></p>\n<p>Manual allocation is most convenient when only one or very few inventory items are involved. (But see the Note below on a simple way to enter data for many items.) It is required when freight-in costs are not proportionally distributed according to line item totals.</p>\n<p>To use the manual allocation method, choose the inventory item to which a freight-in charge applies when entering the payment or purchase invoice to the freight-in supplier, but leave <code class=\"html\">Qty</code> blank. Edit the description to describe the freight-in charge. Enter the freight-in amount in the <code class=\"html\">Unit price</code> field. Repeat this process for every inventory item to which freight-in charges are being allocated. Dates on forms for the purchase and freight-in do not need to match. Average costs will be correctly adjusted as of the transaction date for the freight-in charge.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nNorthwind purchases the same two inventory items from the same supplier as in the last example.

Click <kbd>Create</kbd>.<br>\n<br>A shortcoming of this method is that payments can only be cloned to payments and purchase invoices to purchase invoices. So you cannot generate a freight-in purchase invoice in this way if the original purchase was by cash payment. Nor can you create a payment form if the original purchase was by purchase invoice. In practical application, however, these restrictions are usually not limiting.</p>\n</div></div>\n<p><strong><em>Automatic distribution for separate freight-in charges</em></strong></p>\n<p>Automatic distribution is most convenient when there are many inventory items affected by the same freight-in charge.

First, create a payment or purchase invoice for the freight-in supplier. Post the freight-in amount to <em>Freight clearing</em> or a similarly named balance sheet account. Second, reopen the original purchase invoice on which affected inventory items  were purchased. Add two line items to it. On the first, select <em>Freight-in</em> in the <code class=\"html\">Item</code> field. Make sure <code class=\"html\">Qty</code> is blank (not zero).

In simple terms, buyers are required to withhold a portion of the balance due on invoices and pay that portion directly to the tax authority. Then, either the buyer or the tax authority provides certification of payment of withheld amounts to the seller. The seller reduces subsequent payments of its tax liabilities by amounts already paid on its behalf by buyers.</p>\n<p>Withholding tax may be a form of advance payment of income taxes, value added taxes, goods and service taxes, or some combination of these and other types of tax. Because the entire process involves both buyers and sellers, Manager supports withholding tax accounting through both its sales invoice and purchase invoice processes, though procedures are somewhat different.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-default\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-info-circle\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Notes</strong><br>\nAs implemented in Manager, withholding tax <strong>does not</strong> refer to deductions on payslips of taxes due from employees.

Your supplier might use either of two methods for calculating taxes and discounts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Calculate tax and discount on each line item individually, round the amounts, then total them.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Total line item amounts, then apply taxes and discounts.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Most automated accounting systems (including Manager) use the first method, because individual line items are often posted to different accounts and it is necessary that rounding be applied to each line item. The second method is typically used when invoices are prepared manually, because fewer calculations are needed when taxes and discounts are calculated on the total invoice amount rather than each line item. If your supplier uses the second method, the calculated total in Manager may be different from the total on the supplier’s invoice.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nDerek buys two different items from his supplier for $11.55 and $24.59 and receives a 3% discount. No tax is assessed.<br>\n<br>Derek creates a purchase invoice in Manager (using the first method), so the discount is applied to individual amounts, the line figures are rounded, then the two discounted prices are totaled. $11.55 is discounted to $11.2035 and rounded to <strong>$11.20</strong>. $24.59 is discounted to $23.8523 and rounded to <strong>$23.85</strong>. The total using the first method is <strong>$35.05</strong>, shown on his purchase invoice as below:<br>\n<br><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/5/539f5ed3a31549291c46f50c014a0bea697c88b1.png\" width=\"176\" height=\"151\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"><br>\n<br>But Derek’s supplier used the second method.

Derek is tempted to ignore it.

Instead, calculate discounted unit prices manually and enter those in the <code class=\"html\">Unit price</code> fields. This gives you complete freedom to adjust the discounted, rounded amounts manually so they add up to the total amount charged on the sales invoice received from the supplier. The selection of which line item price to adjust is arbitrary and will generally have negligible impact on average unit cost of any inventory items involved. Regardless, the difference must be taken up somewhere so your purchase invoice total matches the supplier’s sales invoice.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nDerek manually calculates discounted unit prices.

You want any credits to be automatically applied to invoices, so you are not trying to collect from a customer more than is really owed to you and you don’t pay suppliers more than you really owe them. For example, if a customer has a credit balance of $100 due to a credit note, Manager will remember this until the next invoice is issued to that customer and will automatically apply the $100 credit to it without your having to keep track of it. But if you are certain the customer or supplier didn’t have a credit balance, such an automatic credit allocation indicates something has been recorded incorrectly.</p>\n<p>In the example above, the problem is easy to diagnose.

Typically, a debit note is created in response to a credit note received by the business from a supplier, although not all supplier credits are formally documented. Debit notes are internal; that is, they are not normally provided to the supplier. They might be for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Return of goods</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Adjustment (refund) of price for goods or services previously delivered</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Overpayment of amounts billed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A debit note makes all necessary corrections to inventory, expense, and tax accounts. It does not record actual receipt of money from the supplier, but only adjusts the supplier’s balance in <em>Accounts payable</em>. A debit note can be created regardless of whether the supplier has yet been paid for the goods or services.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-default\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-info-circle\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong><br>\nA debit note should not normally be used if the original transaction was a <a href=\"/guides/7325\">cash purchase</a>, because the purchase will not have been recorded in the supplier’s subaccount in <em>Accounts payable</em>. In such situations, a direct receipt should usually be entered in the <kbd>Bank Transactions</kbd> or <kbd>Cash Transactions</kbd> tab. In these cases, enter quantities returned to the supplier as negative numbers. However, if the cash seller has also been defined as a supplier and offers an account credit rather than a cash refund, a debit note may be used.</p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Enable the <kbd>Debit Notes</kbd> tab</h3>\n<p>Before debit notes can be created, the <kbd>Debit Notes</kbd> tab must be enabled.

It does not include fixed assets, such as equipment or buildings. Nor does it include tools or consumable supplies used during operations. The value of inventory is an asset, because it can generate future income. Therefore, it appears on a company’s balance sheet.</p>\n<p>So inventory must be counted and valued. It must be tracked as it is produced, bought, or sold. Manager includes many features to help <strong>manage inventory</strong>. Some are essential; others are optional. Program behavior changes, depending on which tools are used. This Guide explains how various tools and capabilities interact so you can decide which to use in your situation. It is divided into three parts: Introduction, <a href=\"/guides/11128\">Continuation</a>, and <a href=\"/guides/11130\">Conclusion</a>. You are reading Part 1 Introduction.</p>\n<p>The three parts of this Guide do not furnish detailed, step-by-step instructions for enabling functional tabs, completing transaction forms, or generating reports. Those can be found in <a href=\"https://www.manager.io/guides/\">other Guides</a>, to which hyperlinks are provided. Instead, they focus on relationships between the inventory management features of the program:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><a href=\"/guides/7551\">Inventory items</a></strong> are defined elements by which inventory is managed. They can have purchase and sales prices, specified tax codes to be applied, and individual units of measure. Their costs and revenues can be assigned to custom accounts. Most importantly, they have standard item codes, names, and descriptions by which they can be referenced.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><a href=\"/guides/7189\">Purchase invoices</a></strong> record purchases of inventory items from suppliers on credit.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><a href=\"/guides/7178\">Sales invoices</a></strong> record sales of inventory items to customers on credit.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong>Cash <a href=\"/guides/7321\">sales</a> and <a href=\"/guides/7325\">purchases</a></strong> record transactions of inventory items paid at the time.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><a href=\"/guides/7767\">Production orders</a></strong> record in-house manufacture of inventory items from other inventory items and non-inventory cost inputs.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><a href=\"/guides/9629\">Inventory kits</a></strong> are sales entry shortcuts for combinations of inventory items  stocked individually but sold together under a single identification. (The items may also be sold individually in other transactions.)</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><a href=\"/guides/10676\">Delivery notes</a></strong> document delivery of goods to a location or customer.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><a href=\"/guides/10704\">Goods receipts</a></strong> document receipt of goods at a location or from a supplier.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><a href=\"/guides/10677\">Inventory locations</a></strong> are discrete places where inventory items are physically stored, such as different warehouses or shops.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><a href=\"/guides/10707\">Inventory transfers</a></strong> record movement of inventory items between inventory locations.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><a href=\"/guides/10709\">Inventory write-offs</a></strong> document the loss, damage, or other non-revenue-producing reduction of inventory.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><a href=\"/guides/7468\">Inventory reports</a></strong> provide information on changes in quantities, values, or locations of inventory. They also list profitability and price of inventory items.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-default\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-info-circle\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Note</strong><br>\nPurchase orders and sales orders are not included in this discussion because they are not actual financial transactions and have no impact on inventory. They are convenient shortcuts for recording orders to suppliers or from customers. And they can by copied to other transactions that affect inventory. But in the current version of Manager, purchase orders do not adjust inventory availability or backorder status. Nor do sales orders commit inventory to a particular customer or future sales transaction.</p>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nAll three parts of this Guide illustrate various aspects of inventory management using an example company, Brilliant Industries. Brilliant Industries sells electric lamps and lamp parts at wholesale. It is not required to collect or pay any taxes on sales or purchases in its jurisdiction.

ACME Distributing presents its sales invoice upon delivery of the merchandise. So as soon as Brilliant enters the corresponding purchase invoice, the items are considered to be in stock. Edison Electrical Supply sells only over the counter. So Brilliant’s owner leaves Edison’s warehouse with purchased items in hand, having written a check on the spot.<br>\n<br>Brilliant enables the <kbd>Purchase Invoices</kbd> tab. The <kbd>Bank Accounts</kbd> and <kbd>Receipts &amp; Payments</kbd> tabs were enabled when the company’s bank account was established. The two transactions are entered as below:<br>\n<br><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/3X/b/3/b3c0373576bcb3e9ba80adcc9ebb6fc6983976e5.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"><br>\n<br><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/3X/8/4/841165dcf9b76597c3103fa86f7f860463eda0a6.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"><br>\n<br>Since all transactions were complete when they were entered, there is no need for Brilliant Industries to enable the <kbd>Goods Receipts</kbd> tab. The <kbd>Inventory Items</kbd> list shows the results of the two purchases:<br>\n<br><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/3/3594aa9cc20aeb974a8b7c04727fbf40f93bda4f.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Producing inventory</h3>\n<p>When inventory items are produced in-house, production orders record consumption of resources and output of new finished goods.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nBrilliant Industries can buy finished table lamps from ACME Distributing. But it can also produce them from parts purchased from various suppliers. It decides to manufacture a batch of 3 table lamps. So it enables the <kbd>Production Orders</kbd> tab and enters the following production order:<br>\n<br><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/0/0eee70a56da622633ddeaa32ac03ee87c1f13c50.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"><br>\n<br>The inventory listing shows the increase in finished table lamps, as well as reductions in the three items that went into production. Also notice that average cost of table lamps has declined because of the production order. The cost of input items for a lamp (87.00 + 24.35 + 3.25 = 114.60) plus labor (75.00 / 3 = 25.00) is less (139.60) than the purchase cost of a finished lamp (195.00). In other words, Brilliant Industries can assemble table lamps itself for less than it can buy them, potentially allowing more profit:<br>\n<br><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/b/b9e5f6066c9baf79f66024cfad43e4d97bd78669.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"><br>\n<br>Also note that total value of inventory has risen because of the 75.00 labor cost to manufacture 3 lamps. The company now has more invested in its inventory. But it can also sell that same inventory for much more because of the value added through manufacturing operations.</p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Selling inventory</h3>\n<p>Inventory can be sold with sales invoices or cash receipts.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nBrilliant Industries sells products to Bob’s Hardware. It enables the <kbd>Sales Invoices</kbd> tab and records the sale on the following sales invoice:<br>\n<br><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/3X/b/c/bcd9598e3100ea4b0f6206c5d5129fc2993b1bbe.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"><br>\n<br>It also sells 1 case of LED bulbs to Lumen Lighting for cash, and enters that transaction as a receipt. Quantities on hand have decreased for table lamps, 60 Watt bulbs, and LED bulbs:<br>\n<br><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/d/d3e94b41cf2c42ee203efcb6b2e51389ca9f82a9.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"><br>\n<br>Because the goods were delivered immediately and either accompanied by a sales invoice or a cash receipt, Brilliant Industries did not use the <kbd>Delivery Notes</kbd> tab. Manager treated all inventory movements as having happened immediately.</p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Understanding backorders</h3>\n<p>When you have sold more inventory items than you own (have on hand) the situation is described as a <em><strong>backorder</strong></em>. That term is somewhat misleading, because additional stock has not necessarily been ordered. This situation shows up in Manager as negative inventory quantities. The negative quantity indicates how many units of the inventory item must be purchased or produced to satisfy existing sales.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nIf Brilliant Industries had sold 3 cases of LEDs to Lumen Lighting in the previous example, a backorder situation would exist, because only 2 had been purchased and were on hand. The inventory list would show a quantity on hand of -1:<br>\n<br><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/f/f1958a8670605a7ec2bb1b6c6170d47f7c4175f1.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Inventory reports</h3>\n<p>Four reports became available when the <kbd>Inventory Items</kbd> tab was enabled:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong>Inventory Value Movement</strong> lists opening balances, value added through purchases or production orders, cost (on an average cost basis) of inventory sold, adjustments, and closing balances. The report can be generated for any defined period of time. An inventory item that is out of stock for the entire period will not be listed, because there will be neither value nor value movement at any time during the period. But an item that is in stock but has no movement will be included.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nBrilliant Industries began the year with no inventory, made initial purchases, produced some lamps, and made sales. Its Inventory Value Movement report is shown below.

It also covers backorders and content of inventory reports when only basic functions are enabled. If you have not yet read Part 1, you should read it first.</p>\n<p>This Part 2 covers more advanced features, including inventory kits, delivery notes, and goods receipts. It describes how the program’s behavior changes when these additional functions are used. Information in Part 1 is not repeated here.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/guides/11130\">Part 3</a> describes additional capabilities: inventory locations, transfers, and write-offs. You will need to understand information in Parts 1 and 2 before you can use the capabilities discussed in Part 3.</p>\n<h3>Inventory kits</h3>\n<p>The simplest enhancement of inventory management is use of <a href=\"/guides/9629\">inventory kits</a>. These are not additional inventory items, but rather groups of already-defined items that are sold together. The items that make them up may also be sold separately. They are defined in the <kbd>Settings</kbd> tab.</p>\n<p>Inventory kits are not pre-assembled, but are grouped together only as sold. They are not counted during physical inventory verification, because they do not exist until sold, so they have no value in <em>Inventory on hand</em>. When an inventory kit is sold, its constituent items are subtracted from inventory quantities on hand (quantities owned) as though they had been sold individually, at their existing average cost. Prices for inventory kits can be different from the sum of constituent prices.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nBrilliant Industries sells table lamps. It also sells a complete parts kit from which an end user can assemble a finished lamp. It sells the kit for more than it would sell the individual components, making additional profit from the confidence a consumer gains that all parts are compatible. Brilliant defines the following inventory kit:<br>\n<br><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/5/5e32f67b98c619b3a6592d8be9c1783286d20880.png\" alt=\"Inventory Kit\" width=\"448\" height=\"468\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"><br>\n<br>Brilliant sells one of these kits to Lumen Lighting. The quantities and values of all four constituent items go down. For example, the number of lamp shades in stock decreases by 1, as shown by this drill-down report from the <kbd>Inventory Items</kbd> list:<br>\n<br><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/b/b320ee06386ba2eba0dafab8aab4cad912f3e799.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Delivery notes</h3>\n<p>A major step up in complexity comes by using <a href=\"/guides/10676\">delivery notes</a>. These document delivery of goods to a location or customer. Their use implies that physical delivery of goods does not always occur simultaneously with issuance of a sales invoice or cash receipt. Possible reasons include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Customer credit is not approved, so goods will not be delivered until payment is received.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Items sold are backordered.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Deliveries are spaced in time per contractual agreement.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Products will be drop-shipped to an end user for the customer.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Sales invoices are issued immediately, with delivery notes serving as packing lists.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When the <kbd>Delivery Notes</kbd> tab is enabled, the <kbd>Inventory Items</kbd> list immediately changes. Two additional columns are added for quantity to be delivered and quantity owned. The original quantity on hand column now shows what should be found on premises, while quantity owned represents what is available to sell.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nBrilliant Industries enables the <kbd>Delivery Notes</kbd> tab. Its <kbd>Inventory Items</kbd> list changes, even though no new transactions have been entered. Notice that everything previously sold by sales invoice (4 table lamps, 6 packs of 60 W bulbs, and 1 complete parts inventory kit) now shows as still to be delivered, including those items sold as part of an inventory kit. Only items sold by cash receipt are considered to have been delivered. However, note that the backorder situation with LEDs still exists. Because that sale of 3 cases exceeded stock on hand of 2 cases, Brilliant Industries still owes 1 case to Lumen Lighting:<br>\n<br><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/9/95c4afbd4f82833a5b14cc7981a9edb65b8b0bc9.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"><br>\n<br>Brilliant Industries enters delivery notes by copying from previous sales invoices. It also purchases 5 additional cases of LEDs from Edison Electrical. The backorder is cleared and all quantities to be delivered are zero:<br>\n<br><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/4/43f04a945d331cd7ac7753a6d457a453f099a144.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-warning\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-exclamation-triangle\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Caution</strong><br>\nManager does not alert you to deliver backordered items sold by cash receipt when stock is replenished. Because the program assumes all cash sales are delivered at the time of transaction, it does not designate unfulfilled quantities as still needing to be delivered. Therefore, if you accept cash payment for inventory you do not have on hand, you will need a separate method to remind you to deliver the remaining quantity. You can, however, drill down on a negative quantity in the <kbd>Inventory Items</kbd> list to see transactions responsible for the backorder situation. And if a single transaction was responsible, Manager will have split it into two entries representing the portions that could and could not be fulfilled. Using this approach, it is easy to confirm who the backordered quantity (shown by a negative balance) should be delivered to.</p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Goods Receipts</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/guides/10704\">Goods receipts</a> provide capability that is a mirror image of delivery notes. That is, they record receipt of goods at a location or from a supplier. When the <kbd>Goods Receipts</kbd> tab is enabled, another column is added to the <kbd>Inventory Items</kbd> list showing quantity to be received. Now, the inventory picture is complete. Quantities purchased (owned) but not yet received are displayed, as are quantities on hand, which should be verifiable by checking stock. Quantities committed to delivery from previous sales and not available to sell to others are listed. Quantities still owned and available for sale without additional purchases or production are visible, too.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nBrilliant Industries is worried that some inventory may not be delivered immediately in the future. So it enables the <kbd>Goods Receipts</kbd> tab to track goods it is awaiting from suppliers. All its back purchase invoice quantities now show as to be received. Quantities purchased with cash payments are assumed to have been delivered immediately:<br>\n<br><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/6/6585fdb965035b94c47213e0f744513e6c5caecd.png\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"><br>\n<br>Brilliant copies past purchase invoices to goods receipts, and the quantities to be received are zeroed out.

The functionality these tabs provide can be very important for some businesses. But they also entail extra work every time an inventory item is purchased or sold. Consider <a href=\"/guides/7067\">creating a test company</a> to explore whether they are truly necessary for your business. They can always be added later.</p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Inventory reports with delivery notes and goods receipts</h3>\n<p>Inventory reports available are not affected by activation of <kbd>Delivery Notes</kbd> and <kbd>Goods Receipts</kbd> tabs. All reports are based on items owned. Thus, they reflect purchases and sales, regardless of whether items have been received or delivered.</p>",

They are defined under <kbd>Settings</kbd>. By default, all inventory is held at a location named <em>Unspecified location</em> until transferred elsewhere.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nBrilliant Industries decides to open a second warehouse for inventory storage and shipment.

And the Inventory Quantity by Location report shows a reduction in quantity on hand at the south warehouse.</p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Inventory effects on financial statements</h3>\n<p>Inventory transactions affect both the Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Statement. Many transactions are posted to accounts created automatically by Manager as relevant tabs are enabled. The principal accounts involved are used as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<em>Inventory on hand</em>, an asset account, reports the value of all inventory items owned but not yet sold. Recorded inventory value can generate future income.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<em>Inventory – sales</em>, an income account, records revenue earned from sales of inventory items.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<em>Inventory – cost</em>, an expense account, records the cost (at average cost) of inventory items sold.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, expense accounts are typically created to collect non-inventory costs of production orders, write-off expenses for advertising, breakage and loss, and internal consumption.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nBrilliant Industries’ Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Statement for the year encompassing all example transactions in the three parts of this Guide are shown below.

This can result in large differences between the main financial statements and inventory reports, making it very difficult to reconcile and verify accounting records. A more complete and accurate representation of business position and performance is provided by accrual basis accounting. For this reason, most accountants strongly prefer accrual basis accounting. And in some tax jurisdictions, companies selling inventory are legally required to use it.</p>\n</div></div>",

However, such exceptions often include restrictions of their own, such as requirements to recapture (give back) accelerated depreciation taken previously if the fixed asset is retired from service or the company goes out of business before the asset’s expected lifespan has passed.

Regardless of the exact situation, the purchase cost of the fixed asset must be removed from the <em>Fixed assets</em> account and its accumulated depreciation must be removed from <em>Fixed assets, accumulated depreciation</em>. Otherwise, the balances of these two accounts would grow endlessly as the business purchases assets over the years, even if those assets are no longer owned. Finally, whether the fixed asset is sold, scrapped, or given away, the difference between its book value and any amount recovered through disposal must be recorded, either as income or expense.</p>\n<p>To dispose of a fixed asset, go to the <kbd>Fixed Assets</kbd> tab, click the <kbd>Edit</kbd> button for the asset disposed, check <kbd>Disposed fixed asset</kbd>, then enter the date of disposal.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nBrilliant Industries decides to replace the packaging machine it purchased in January with a more capable model, even though only three months of its useful life have passed.

Several circumstances may exist. The intangible asset may have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Already been fully amortized over its useful life</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Passed the end of its useful life for your business, but have residual resale value</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Been only partially amortized, with useful life and resale value remaining</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Been partially amortized, but with no value remaining (became useless early)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other circumstances could also apply, especially if special tax provisions covered purchase of the intangible asset. Regardless of the exact situation, the purchase cost of the intangible asset must be removed from the <em>Intangible assets</em> account and its accumulated amortization must be removed from <em>Intangible assets, accumulated amortization</em>. Otherwise, the balances of these two accounts would grow endlessly as the business purchases assets over the years, even if those assets are no longer owned. Finally, whether the intangible asset is sold or has merely lost its value, the difference between its book value and any amount recovered through disposal must be recorded, either as income or expense.</p>\n<p>To dispose of an intangible asset, go to the <kbd>Intangible Assets</kbd> tab, click the <kbd>Edit</kbd> button for the asset disposed, check <kbd>Disposed intangible asset</kbd>, then enter the date of disposal.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nACME Industries’ electric controller patent becomes useless because the company discontinues products in which it is used, even though only two months of its anticipated life have passed.

The default location for application data depends on your operating system and edition, but is the same for all businesses you create.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-default\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-info-circle\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Note</strong><br>\nWhen using the desktop edition, business data files can be stored outside the application data folder and opened directly without first launching the Manager application. This is done by creating a <a href=\"/guides/8890\">backup file</a> in the desired storage location. Business data files stored this way are not also copied to the application data folder, so information below <strong>does not apply</strong> to them.</p>\n</div></div>\n<p>Over time, data storage schemes for Manager have changed to accommodate new program features. Sometimes, an update requires new data files to be created. This happens automatically when the new version of Manager is launched. No action by the user is ever necessary.</p>\n<p>Relic data files are not normally deleted. These obsolete data files and/or folders are harmless and can safely be left in place. By modern standards, they are not large, and do not consume much storage capacity. However, they can be identified and deleted, if desired.</p>\n<h3>Finding your application data</h3>\n<p>To discover the location of your application data, click <kbd>Preferences</kbd> in the top menu bar. To view your application data, navigate to the folder shown. Depending on your operating system and preferences, the folder may be hidden from normal view. So you may need to copy the location and paste it into your operating system’s file search function.</p>\n<p>Once at the data folder, you should see files like these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><code class=\"html\">00000000000000000000000000000000.manager</code></strong> is an SQLite database holding a list of businesses, users, and global preferences. This file is generated automatically the first time you launch Manager and updated as businesses and users are added or removed or global preferences are changed. It contains no accounting data. If the file is deleted, the program will generate an empty version of it. Businesses can be repopulated into the file by <a href=\"/guides/6263\">restoring them from backup</a>.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Files with long, alphanumeric names like <strong><code class=\"html\">69703781b9284b1684e494fdd5510cb8.manager</code></strong> are generated for each business added. Characters in the file name are not related to the name of the business. All accounting data, customer and supplier information, custom themes, settings, and attachments for a business reside in this file. For privacy reasons, no data from any business appears in the file of any other.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><code class=\"html\">data</code></strong> stores the application data folder path. If you have an older version of Manager or have never changed the application data folder location, this file may be missing. If Manager needs it, the program will generate it automatically.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Another file with an alphanumeric name like <strong><code class=\"html\">238097db79f84dc5a44a0c6f8aa04e6c.manager</code></strong> is generated or updated automatically as required. This file contains information about audit trails. If deleted, this file will be automatically regenerated if it is needed.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><code class=\"html\">size</code></strong> (for desktop installations) stores the window size when the application is closed.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><code class=\"html\">password</code></strong> (for server installations) stores the administrator account password</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So if you have two businesses, your file structure might look something like this:</p>\n<p><code class=\"html\">00000000000000000000000000000000.manager</code><br>\n<code class=\"html\">69703781b9284b1684e494fdd5510cb8.manager</code><br>\n<code class=\"html\">76cf56919daf4a3780196f51614b327b.manager</code><br>\n<code class=\"html\">data</code><br>\n<code class=\"html\">238097db79f84dc5a44a0c6f8aa04e6c.manager</code><br>\n<code class=\"html\">size</code></p>\n<p>The current version of Manager does not use or create any other files or folders.</p>\n<h3>Identifying current business files</h3>\n<p>Since Manager does not automatically delete files for removed businesses or obsolete data structures, long-time users who have been through several updates or  removed businesses may need to identify which files with alphanumeric names are currently in use. One way is to enter a transaction in a business and check immediately which file was most recently modified. Files that change only with entries to a single business are the accounting files for those businesses. Make note of the modified files and corresponding businesses. A file that changes with entries to all businesses is the audit trail file. Files not modified by any active business are obsolete.</p>\n<p>Another way to determine which files are active is to open them directly. (This capability became available with Manager version 17.10.0.) Examine transactions in various tabs to see whether the file is up to date.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-warning\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-exclamation-triangle\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Caution</strong><br>\nDo not make any entries in a file you have opened directly as you identify current business files. Such entries will complicate both data identification and recovery efforts you may be undertaking. For more information on directly opening data files, see <a href=\"/guides/12280\">this Guide</a>.</p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Removing unnecessary data</h3>\n<p>After identifying all current business files among those with alphanumeric names, you can remove unnecessary files from the application data folder. To be safe, do not delete them yet. Move the following file types to a safe location:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><code class=\"html\">00000000000000000000000000000000</code></strong> (without the <code class=\"html\">*.manager</code> extension) is an obsolete index the program ignores.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><code class=\"html\">recent</code></strong> is a relic file formerly used in the desktop edition to store a list of recently opened businesses.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><code class=\"html\">language</code></strong> is a relic file that was used to store settings from multiple businesses.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><code class=\"html\">secret</code></strong> is a relic file.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Files with <strong><code class=\"html\">.manager-journal</code></strong> extensions are temporary SQLite rollback journals created when database revisions are necessary. They help prevent database corruption. The application normally deletes them when they are no longer needed. They remain only if an overly aggressive backup process interrupted a file conversion.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Files with plain-language names like <strong><code class=\"html\">Northwind Traders.manager</code></strong> were generated automatically by the desktop edition under a prior file naming scheme.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong>Folders</strong>, regardless of their names, are relics of obsolete data structures.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">Files with alphanumeric names like <strong><code class=\"html\">f565db9ce66044188729588d6f5f2269.manager</code></strong> determined <em>not</em> to be associated with active businesses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Relaunch Manager and verify all active businesses are still present and contain expected accounting and custom theme data. If an active business file was moved from the application data folder by accident, Manager will regenerate a file with the required name. However, the recreated business will have only default tabs and no accounting data. The <a href=\"/guides/9123\">recreated business should be removed</a>. The associated data file should be deleted. (It will probably be the most recently created file in the folder.) The previously removed file with the same name should be moved back into the application data folder.</p>\n<p>When satisfied all businesses are present and include expected data, delete removed files from their temporary location.</p>",

Basically, all you need to do is define a <strong>CNAME</strong> record for your custom domain that points to your Manager Cloud URL.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>\n<p>Log into your domain provider’s site and determine where to manage your Domain Name Server (DNS) settings. Depending on your provider, this may be called Zone File Settings, Manage Domains, Domain Manager, DNS Manager, or something similar.</p>\n<p>Here, you will create a new record so your subdomain correctly links to Manager Cloud.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>\n<p>In your provider’s DNS manager, create a CNAME record with these values (order and presentation may vary):</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><code class=\"html\">Name</code></strong>, <strong><code class=\"html\">Alias</code></strong> or <strong><code class=\"html\">Host Name</code></strong>: enter your subdomain. For example, if you’re connecting <code class=\"html\">accounting.yourbusinessname.com</code>, you should enter just <code class=\"html\">accounting</code>.</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><code class=\"html\">Type</code></strong> or <strong><code class=\"html\">Record Type</code></strong>:  indicate CNAME or CNAME Alias</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><code class=\"html\">Value</code></strong> or <strong><code class=\"html\">Points to</code></strong>: enter <code class=\"html\">yourbusinessname.manager.io</code> (your URL for Manager Cloud).</li>\n<li class=\"p-1\">\n<strong><code class=\"html\">TTL</code></strong> or <strong><code class=\"html\">Time to Live</code></strong>: set to 1 hour (3600 seconds).</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nA custom domain name, <code class=\"html\">accounting.luboshasko.com</code>, can be set up to point to the Manager Cloud URL <code class=\"html\">lubos.manager.io</code> in a typical DNS manager:<br>\n<br><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/c/cdd2aee575c9422f647f00d3173274035b49e340.png\" alt=\"BpuNCMN\" width=\"415\" height=\"334\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n</div></div>\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>\n<p>Depending on your provider, it may take from 5 minutes to 24 hours for a custom domain to become active. When you are able to navigate to your custom domain, Manager Cloud will automatically download and install an SSL certificate from <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/\">Let’s encrypt</a> so your connection will be still safe and secure.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-example\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-hand-point-right\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Example</strong><br>\nAfter setting up the custom domain <code class=\"html\">accounting.luboshasko.com</code> as described above and logging in, a browser will display the secure connection as below:<br>\n<br><img src=\"https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/business5/uploads/manager1/original/2X/d/d1c7b870ce0280adefb8d365a221037c9fe24c52.png\" alt=\"myexample\" width=\"562\" height=\"161\" class=\"img-thumbnail img-fluid mb-1\"></p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Final words</h3>\n<p>When custom domains were added (in Manager version 17.9.63), unnecessary <code class=\"html\">manager.io</code> branding was removed from the cloud edition. So, if you use a custom domain, your restricted users will see your custom URL with no reference to <a href=\"http://www.manager.io\">www.manager.io</a>.</p>\n<p>This is especially useful for accounting firms or bookkeepers whose clients might be reluctant to do their books under an unfamiliar <code class=\"html\">.manager.io</code> domain. Instead, they can keep their accounting records under the domain name of a service provider they already recognize and trust.</p>\n<div class=\"media p-4 mb-4 media-default\"><i style=\"font-size: 48px\" class=\"fa text-muted mr-3 mt-2 d-none d-lg-block fa-info-circle\"></i><div class=\"media-body\">\n<p><strong>Note</strong><br>\nSetting up a custom domain name will not deactivate your original <code class=\"html\">*.manager.io</code> URL.
