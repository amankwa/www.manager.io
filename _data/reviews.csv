John S.,"The Banking Dashboard in Manager makes it very easy to manage banking transactions. The bank reconciliation tool is the best I have ever seen. It has custom field feature and custom fields can be set to appear as column in tables on documents. It is light weight despite it many features and opens and closes very fast, it takes up very small system resources. The search tool makes it very easy to find transactions. It has reports which are not present in many popular paid accounting software. Has AR, AP, GL, Payroll, Fixed and Intangible Asset Management, expense claims, inventory management etc. Manager has a lot of customising features so you can make your documents look exactly how you want. Finally the Desktop (single User) is totally free and comes with all the features the server and cloud versions have."
Hennie E.,"Manager.io is very solid. It never crashes and it is very flexible in a way that you can print reports from any date till any date. It is for instance, very easy to drill down to the basic-entry. Also the functionality is great. It is however very important that, if you are unexperienced with accounting software, you ask someone with experience to help you setting up the system. It saves a lot of time at a later stage. So take time to read the guides. This is just a general remark and warning for everybody new. The advantage of Manager.io is that you can fairly easy correct your mistakes."
Norman S.,"I'm a novice small business bookkeeper without formal training. I've used Quickbooks/Quicken and Manager is miles ahead for what I want. It has a simple, uncluttered interface, pages/forms are simple to complete, the pre-configured reports are well-designed, and it uses very few system resources so it's quick to open, use and close. The Manager Forum is a fantastic resource and although I have no programming background, I've customised some themes successfully."
Pieter C.,"One of the easiest software to use and it is free."
zuri M.," It's amazing, no stress, no worries, and very smart app, I have been using it for the last three years. No problems at all, whats beautiful is that you dont need internet."
Junjie L.," I like that Manager provides a (free) desktop edition of its accounting software for the Mac. At a time where most accounting software are going on the cloud, which can be slow waiting for things to load, Manager's desktop edition is like a breath of fresh air where you can just key in what you need quickly without waiting. If you need to key in lots of entries, these waiting time really adds up."
Paul K.,"Looks good, Easy to use and flexible ........ and the desktop version is free !!! We have been with MYOB for over 25 years. Being a small business we couldn't afford there over priced subscription costs that they now push. I found Manager.io and haven't looked back. I would gladly pay the once of fee for the server version if STP and EMDUPE files are included."
