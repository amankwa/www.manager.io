# Specifying the Ruby version
# By default Netlify uses Ruby v2.1.2. This version is not compatible with the jekyll-algolia.
# To fix this, youâ€™ll have to add a file named .ruby-version at the root of your repository. The file content should be 2.4. It will be picked up by Netlify and used as the local Ruby version.
2.4
